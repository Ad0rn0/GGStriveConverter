The universe's most precious book is just another toy to you, huh?
vsol401demoa_0_ask
...The hell're you?
vsol401demoa_5_ask
Am I daydreamin'?
vsol651demoa_0_bgt
Go home, already.
vsol651demoa_0_sin
Here's hopin' you've done some growing.
vsol401demob_0_ask
...No one told me you had siblings.
vsol401demob_5_ask
You're not the real deal, are ya?
vsol401democ_0_ask
You sure seem like the real thing. How's that work?
vsol401democ_5_ask
You're not a ghost, are ya?
vsol402demoa_0_ask
Hey, tell me that punk ain't dead yet.
vsol402demoa_5_ask
That was for Aria. Mine hasn't even started.
vkyk401demov_0_sol
It looks like you're actually serious.
vsol400demov_0_kyk
Damn right. You're gonna suffer if you half-ass this.
AC_SOL_L1_101
At least you're enthusiastic. Give me a moment.
AC_SOL_L1_111
You're awfully loud for a man who moves like he's half asleep.
AC_SOL_L1_112
Oh, now I'm WIDE awake. Next round, let's go.
AC_SOL_L1_113
Come back after a coffee. We'll pick this up then.
AC_SOL_L1_201
Mind your stance, it's sloppy.
AC_SOL_L1_202
Spare me the lecture and get me a coffee.
AC_SOL_L1_203
Hm.
AC_SOL_L1_211
There's no point in continuing as you are now. You need to get yourself together.
vnag401demow_0_sol
I've long awaited our confrontation, War God.
vsol400demow_0_nag
...Yeah, I can tell.
AC_SOL_L1_401
That's quite the opponent you've run into.
AC_SOL_L1_402
Stay outta this. I'm takin' him down one-on-one.
AC_SOL_L1_403
You hardly count as "one" in your state.
AC_SOL_L1_411
...Impressive.
AC_SOL_L1_412
He's the one who's impressive.
AC_SOL_L1_413
Yeah. Coulda taken him on my own, though.
AC_SOL_L1_421
That's enough. You're hardly at your best today.
AC_SOL_L1_422
We'll finish this another time.
AC_SOL_L1_423
...Shit.
vnag401demox_0_sol
Let us cross blades, War God.
vsol400demox_0_nag
Been waitin' for me, huh?
AC_SOL_L2_401
My apologies, but he has a prior appointment with me.
AC_SOL_L2_402
This'll be over soon enough, just watch.
AC_SOL_L2_403
Come. I'll take you both on.
AC_SOL_L2_411
...Impressive.
AC_SOL_L2_412
Hardly. That was two-on-one.
AC_SOL_L2_413
I'll finish you off myself next time.
AC_SOL_L3_301
Sorry I'm late.
AC_SOL_L3_302
Are you ready?
AC_SOL_L3_303
You're about to find out.
AC_SOL_L3_311
I gave it my all. I'm glad you finally did the same.
AC_SOL_L3_312
Had to bust out my power, though...
AC_SOL_L3_313
And next time, I'll use mine as well.
AC_SOL_L3_321
I gave it my all. Though the same can't be said for you.
AC_SOL_L3_322
What, you wanted me to go full Gear?
AC_SOL_L3_323
Weren't we supposed to take this seriously? Now, again.
vnag401demoy_0_sol
That was a magnificent battle. Now, face me.
vsol400demoy_0_nag
A Nightless, huh? Not what I need right now.
AC_SOL_L3_401
Maybe I'll stop limiting myself, too.
AC_SOL_L3_402
Don't. Even if you win, you won't be left standing.
vnag401demoz_0_sol
I will surpass you, in every aspect!
vsol400demoz_0_nag
...
AC_SOL_L3_501
...Impressive.
AC_SOL_L3_502
Bastard stayed sane to the very end. Now that's something.
vkyk402democ_8
That was a close match.
vkyk400demoa_0
We can begin at any time.
vkyk400demob_0
I will show you the might of the Thunderseal.
vkyk400democ_0
Come at me with your full strength.
vkyk401demoa_0
A king's blade is not just for show.
vkyk401demob_0
Let's have a fine duel.
vkyk401democ_0
Let me show you why they call me lightning.
vkyk402demoa_0
That was a fine bout.
vkyk402demob_0
Challenge me again whenever you like.
vkyk402democ_0
Looks like I win this time.
vkyk402demoa_2
You must train your mind.
vkyk400demoa_0_sol
That's my line.
vkyk401demoa_0_sol
I'm going to give this my all. You ready?
vkyk402demoa_0_sol
You were supposed to give it your all.
vkyk401demoa_0_kyk
This sword is heavier than it appears.
vkyk400demoa_0_kyk
I may know that better than you.
vkyk401demob_0_kyk
Can you shoulder the weight of the kingdom?
vkyk400demob_0_kyk
For the sake of my family, I must.
vkyk402demoa_0_kyk
The only difference between us was the strength of our resolve.
vkyk400demoa_0_leo
If it's just the title, you can keep it.
vkyk401demoa_0_leo
I hope you haven't gotten rusty.
vkyk402demoa_0_leo
It seems we've both gotten stronger.
vkyk400demoa_0_sin
Sol, you...! What did you teach him now?!
vkyk400demoa_0_tst
She's not as weak as you think she is.
vkyk401demoa_0_sin
Do you know your arithmetic, at least?
vkyk401demoa_0_tst
My power is for protecting... and for building.
vkyk402demoa_0_sin
Great fight.
vkyk402demob_0_sin
I'm doubling your homework.
vkyk402democ_0_sin
Such pressure... I thought I was fighting Sol for a moment.
vkyk651demoa_0_tst
My power is for protecting... and for building.
vkyk651demob_0_tst
My power is for protecting... and for building.
vkyk651democ_0_tst
My power is for protecting... and for building.
vkyk650demoa_0_tst
She's not as weak as you think she is.
vkyk650demob_0_tst
She's not as weak as you think she is.
vkyk650democ_0_tst
She's not as weak as you think she is.
vsol401demov_0_kyk
You'd better go full throttle.
vkyk400demov_0_sol
Why don't you try and make me?
AC_KYK_L1_101
Heh, that's what I like to see. But that's just a start.
AC_KYK_L1_111
Thought I told you to go all out. You're fighting me like I'm a human.
AC_KYK_L1_112
Only because you're acting like one. Stop holding back.
AC_KYK_L1_113
Cram it. Next time, I'll tear you apart.
AC_KYK_L1_201
Spending more time with the pen than the sword lately, huh?
AC_KYK_L1_202
I'll be warmed up soon enough.
AC_KYK_L1_203
Soon enough? We're fighting now.
AC_KYK_L1_211
I dunno what's wrong with you, but you're looking tragic.^n;Get your shit together.
vnag401demow_0_kyk
You're no ordinary human... I can smell it.
vkyk400demow_0_nag
The same could be said for you.
AC_KYK_L1_401
What's he doing here?
AC_KYK_L1_402
Two of you, then? So be it.
AC_KYK_L1_403
Does he intend to fight both of us at once...?
AC_KYK_L1_411
...Impressive.
AC_KYK_L1_412
That was too damn close.
AC_KYK_L1_413
Clearly our skills could use some refinement...
AC_KYK_L1_421
You wield your blade like a sportsman.
AC_KYK_L1_422
Do not approach me as if I were human.^n;Show me the demon beneath your youthful facade.
AC_KYK_L1_423
Why is everyone saying that to me?
AC_KYK_L1_424
You're just as human as I am.
AC_KYK_L1_425
We've both just got a little something extra in us.
AC_KYK_L1_426
You have the same look in your eyes that my master did, long, long ago.
vnag401demox_0_kyk
You've reached heights thought unattainable within a single lifetime.^n;What makes you push so hard?
vkyk400demox_0_nag
...What are you doing here?
AC_KYK_L2_401
Stay outta this. This guy's mine.
AC_KYK_L2_402
Worry not. I'll simply take the both of you on.
AC_KYK_L2_403
He's not joking, Sol! Here he comes!
AC_KYK_L2_411
...Impressive.
AC_KYK_L2_412
Even together, we could barely beat him...
AC_KYK_L2_413
I have to get stronger. That much is certain.
AC_KYK_L3_301
You're looking a bit better than you were earlier.
AC_KYK_L3_302
My look's just the start of my improvements.
AC_KYK_L3_303
Bring it on, then.
AC_KYK_L3_311
You'd better not have any complaints after that.
AC_KYK_L3_312
I'll say it again: stop fighting me like I'm a human.
AC_KYK_L3_313
I'd have considered it if you gave me a reason to.
AC_KYK_L3_321
Not good enough.
AC_KYK_L3_322
Not good enough?
AC_KYK_L3_323
There's more to you than this. Show me.
vnag401demoy_0_kyk
You wield your sword to protect others? Intriguing.
vkyk400demoy_0_nag
It can harm others as well. Don't make me use it.
AC_KYK_L3_401
Urgh... My body...
AC_KYK_L3_402
You're at your limit. That's enough.
vnag401demoz_0_kyk
You're still concealing something. Something inhuman.
vkyk400demoz_0_nag
His power's still increasing? How...?
AC_KYK_L3_501
...Impressive.
AC_KYK_L3_502
He managed to keep control of his power... Had the fight gone on...
vmay400demoa_0
You'd better not treat me like a child.
vmay400demob_0
You'd better not cry!
vmay400democ_0
It's too early to be acting cool.
vmay401demoa_0
I'll do my best, Johnny!
vmay401demob_0
You don't look so tough.
vmay401democ_0
I'm on a roll today.
vmay610a_0
Everyone together...
vmay402demoa_0
WE WON!!
vmay610b_0
Ready, set...
vmay402demob_0
BY THE WIND!
vmay610c_0
Jellyfish...
vmay402democ_0
VICTORY!!!
vmay401demoa_0_may
Johnny likes people who are strong!
vmay400demoa_0_may
I'm not so sure that's you.
vmay401demob_0_may
It's like I'm looking into a mirror.
vmay400demob_0_may
But what matters is within, right?
vmay400demoa_0_tst
You haven't changed a bit.
vmay401demoa_0_tst
Wanna see how I've grown?
vchp401demov_0_may
...Domestic training?
vmay400demov_0_chp
Yup! You'll help out, right?
AC_MAY_L1_101
Man, you've really gotten tougher...
AC_MAY_L1_102
Tougher...?^n;That's weird, I was trying to be more ladylike...
AC_MAY_L1_103
Oh? What makes a good woman, then?^n;Money? Looks? Attitude?
AC_MAY_L1_104
I've honestly got no idea.
AC_MAY_L1_111
Stop! You need to focus your energy!
AC_MAY_L1_112
Focus, huh... Will that make me more of a lady?
AC_MAY_L1_113
Of course! Everyone wants a lady with spirit!
AC_MAY_L1_201
Looks like you could use some backup.
AC_MAY_L1_202
Would you mind?
AC_MAY_L1_211
It takes real strength to be willing to ask for help.
AC_MAY_L1_212
Don't get too reliant on it, though.^n;Sometimes, you gotta face your troubles alone.
vnag401demow_0_may
A child? Are you lost?
vmay400demow_0_nag
Think I'm a kid, huh?^n;Why don't you see for yourself?
AC_MAY_L1_401
Hey! Dummy! Don't you realize how strong he is?!
AC_MAY_L1_402
It would seem you're quite skilled, yourself.
AC_MAY_L1_403
Are you seriously ignoring me now?
AC_MAY_L1_411
...That was fun.
AC_MAY_L1_412
Tch. This guy's acting like we're a joke.
AC_MAY_L1_413
That... That wasn't his full strength?
AC_MAY_L1_414
For all my domestic training...^n;he still won't take me seriously.
AC_MAY_L1_421
I reaaaaally don't think I'm gonna beat him...
AC_MAY_L1_422
Oh, you were trying to defeat me?^n;You've got a lot of pluck for a child.
AC_MAY_L1_423
....Is having pluck ladylike?
AC_MAY_L1_424
...You should go home before it gets dark.
vnag401demox_0_may
This place is no playground, child.
vmay400demox_0_nag
Don't you have bingo to get to?
AC_MAY_L2_401
Hey! Ix-nay on the aunts-tay! You're not gonna win!
AC_MAY_L2_402
What about if you fight with me, Chipp?
AC_MAY_L2_403
Well, this might be fun indeed.
AC_MAY_L2_411
An aimless fight to the death... ^n;I'd forgotten how much joy a battle could provide.
AC_MAY_L2_412
Young woman, your spirit is admirable.
AC_MAY_L2_413
Right?!
AC_MAY_L2_414
Not really sure what that means, but thanks.
AC_MAY_L2_415
Let us meet again, odd couple.
AC_MAY_L2_416
We're not a couple.
AC_MAY_L2_417
We're not a couple.
AC_MAY_L3_301
Hey, Chipp, about what you said earlier...^n;Do you know what makes a good woman?
AC_MAY_L3_302
I've got my own thoughts, if you want 'em.
AC_MAY_L3_311
To be honest... I don't really get what you're after here.
AC_MAY_L3_312
What...?
AC_MAY_L3_313
But that doesn't matter.^n;A woman giving something her all... that's cool as hell.
AC_MAY_L3_314
You're working hard for your friends and the man you like.^n;Sounds like a good woman to me.
AC_MAY_L3_315
Should I be happy with just that?
AC_MAY_L3_316
Yeah, just keep doing you.^n;You'll figure it out along the way.
AC_MAY_L3_321
So, what does it mean to be an attractive lady?
AC_MAY_L3_322
That's a question without an answer.
AC_MAY_L3_323
Er... What?
AC_MAY_L3_324
Any answer you might find out there^n;belongs to someone who isn't you.
AC_MAY_L3_325
If you don't know your answer to that^n;question right now, then that's just fine.
AC_MAY_L3_326
Y-You really think so?
vnag401demoy_0_may
A child, in this land of carnage?^n;You are an unusual youth indeed.
vmay400demoy_0_nag
Yeah, well. I'm no child.
AC_MAY_L3_401
A valiant effort indeed.
AC_MAY_L3_402
Guess I'll take that as a compliment!
vnag401demoz_0_may
But you must leave. Beyond this point, only death awaits.
vmay400demoz_0_nag
Eh? Hang on, that doesn't sound good...!
AC_MAY_L3_501
Unbelievable... To think you of all people^n;could bring me back to my senses.
AC_MAY_L3_502
I couldn't believe it myself.
AC_MAY_L3_503
I could tell that you were trying to protect me, though.
AC_MAY_L3_504
Hmm. Thank you, stranger.^n;You are a truly splendid woman.
AC_MAY_L3_505
Splendid, huh? Yeah, I'll take that!^n;I guess Chipp was right after all!
vaxl400demoa_0
Think you can reach me?
vaxl400demoa_1
Let me know when you wanna give up.
vaxl400demob_0
Let's get this started.
vaxl400democ_0
No more messin' around, eh?
vaxl401demoa_0
Take it easy on me, eh?
vaxl401demoa_1
I've got you on my radar.
vaxl401demob_0
You better think up a cool way to lose, mate.
vaxl401democ_0
I'm playing the lead here. Got it?
vaxl402demoa_0
That was too easy!
vaxl402demoa_1
Need me to escort you home?
vaxl402demob_0
I'm pretty cool, right?
vaxl402democ_0
Shoulda stopped when you had the chance.
vaxl400demoa_0_sol
Abracadabra!
vaxl401demoa_0_sol
I'd like a handicap if possible.
vaxl402demoa_0_sol
Thank God for that handicap...
vaxl401demoa_0_axl
Wow, lookin' good.
vaxl400demoa_0_axl
Right back atcha.
vaxl401demob_0_axl
What if we're BOTH the real one?
vaxl400demob_0_axl
I was just thinking that!
vaxl402demoa_0_axl
Sorry, mate, but I've got lady luck on my side.
vaxl400demoa_0_ino
The only thing shortening's the distance between us.
vaxl401demoa_0_ino
Got a minute to chat?
vaxl402demoa_0_ino
We gotta do this again sometime.
vgio401demov_0_axl
Hey, can I ask you for directions?
vaxl400demov_0_gio
Well, it depends...
AC_AXL_L1_101
Okay, hold on! THAT's how you ask for directions?
AC_AXL_L1_102
I guess. Never been much for manners.
AC_AXL_L1_103
Didn't think you'd just tell me what I wanted to hear anyway.
AC_AXL_L1_104
Then why bother asking me in the first place...? Honestly...
AC_AXL_L1_111
Oh, forget it.
AC_AXL_L1_112
Er, sorry?
AC_AXL_L1_113
Doesn't look like I'm getting any directions out of you.^n;I'll figure it out myself.
AC_AXL_L1_201
Looks like you're having some trouble. Let me lend you a hand.
AC_AXL_L1_202
Huh? Oh, uh, cheers.
AC_AXL_L1_211
Now that I've helped you out, it's time to repay the favor.
AC_AXL_L1_212
It's not a favor if it's paid!
AC_AXL_L1_213
It's against my principles to work for free.
AC_AXL_L1_214
What is it you're so bloody desperate to ask me?
AC_AXL_L1_215
Still dodging, huh? Then I'm done here.
vnag401demow_0_axl
What do you want?
vaxl400demow_0_nag
Just wanted to hear your thoughts...
AC_AXL_L1_401
Figured this is where you'd end up.
AC_AXL_L1_402
Wha-- Have you been tailing me?!
AC_AXL_L1_403
It doesn't seem like you're here to chat.
AC_AXL_L1_411
Weren't you supposed to be working together?
AC_AXL_L1_412
Erm, sorry, love, but I was here first.
AC_AXL_L1_413
Ever heard of "ladies first"? I thought you were a gentleman.
AC_AXL_L1_414
*sigh* Settle your little dispute and come face me again.
AC_AXL_L1_415
Is this supposed to be an ending?
AC_AXL_L1_421
Disappointing. You never really intended to fight, did you?
AC_AXL_L1_422
Said so in the first place, didn't I?
AC_AXL_L1_423
Now as for that chat... Have you ever considered becoming a human?
AC_AXL_L1_424
...I don't bother considering the impossible.
vnag401demox_0_axl
...What is your business, child of god?
vaxl400demox_0_nag
Well, just listen for a minute...
AC_AXL_L2_401
Okay, so there's a very dangerous lady coming our way, we need to mo--
AC_AXL_L2_402
Hey, that's cheating.
AC_AXL_L2_403
Oop, too late, there she is now.
AC_AXL_L2_404
I sensed her malice. She's come to slay a beast.
AC_AXL_L2_411
Okay, I'm out. There's no point in doing this two-on-one.
AC_AXL_L2_412
Couldn't you have said that earlier...?^n;Now, to get back to our conversation...
AC_AXL_L2_413
I wanted to ask... If you had a chance to become human again, would you take it?
AC_AXL_L2_414
Is that even possible?
AC_AXL_L2_415
Let's just say I know a guy.^n;Try to remember that for now.
AC_AXL_L2_416
If I could undo it all, then I would.
AC_AXL_L3_301
You already know where I'm headed, but you never intended to tell me how to get there.
AC_AXL_L3_302
How did you know that?
AC_AXL_L3_303
I'm kind of special.
AC_AXL_L3_311
You do know we could've talked this out, right?
AC_AXL_L3_312
You intend to make that samurai a normal human, right?^n;I can't have that.
AC_AXL_L3_313
I've got a score to settle with him.
AC_AXL_L3_314
You a mind-reader, then?
AC_AXL_L3_315
I don't know what your story is, but I'm not looking for any trouble.
AC_AXL_L3_316
Haah...
AC_AXL_L3_321
That's weird. I can usually see a person's past and family tree if I get a good look at them.
AC_AXL_L3_322
But you're a complete blank.
AC_AXL_L3_323
Are you...one of those?
AC_AXL_L3_324
Forget it. I'll just follow my nose.
AC_AXL_L3_325
Hey, wait! Aw, dammit...
vnag401demoy_0_axl
It's you. Why are you here?
vaxl400demoy_0_nag
Just listen to my story. Once upon a time, there was an elderly couple--
AC_AXL_L3_401
Impressive. Your technique may be lacking, but you still held me off.
AC_AXL_L3_402
I'm just trying to help you.
vnag401demoz_0_axl
Forgive me, but as a warrior, I cannot turn down an opportunity to fight.
vaxl400demoz_0_nag
For once in my life, I'd like to have a normal conversation...
AC_AXL_L3_501
And just what, in your godlike wisdom, do you see in me that's worth saving?
AC_AXL_L3_502
Salvation's got nothing to do with it. I just wanted to know what you'd do, if you had the chance.
AC_AXL_L3_503
...I can only correct the path before me. There's no way to wipe clean the trail of blood I've left behind.
AC_AXL_L3_504
If you keep carrying on like this, then nothing will change.
AC_AXL_L3_505
Is your stubbornness bushido... or some sort of self-punishment?
AC_AXL_L3_506
...Perhaps I'm trying to avoid asking myself that very question.
vchp400demoa_0
Let's get started.
vchp400demob_0
This is your only chance to stop me.
vchp400democ_0
If you lose, you gotta be a ninja.
vchp401demoa_0
Just watch me, master!
vchp401demob_0
I'm givin' you your last rites.
vchp401democ_0
Death walks behind you.
vchp402demoa_0
That didn't even kill much time.
vchp402demob_0
This is the power of a ninja.
vchp402democ_0
Go be a ninja.
vchp400demoa_0_nag
Took the words right outta my mouth.
vchp401demoa_0_nag
Where did you learn those techniques?
vchp400demoa_0_anj
You say that now.
vchp401demoa_0_anj
Save your dancing for the stage.
vmay401demov_0_chp
Wanna help with my domestic training?
vchp400demov_0_may
Sure, I'm domestic as hell.
AC_CHP_L1_101
That doesn't count. We helped you TOO much.
AC_CHP_L1_102
Wh-What do you mean?
AC_CHP_L1_103
Dodomezaki.
AC_CHP_L1_104
He's been training with me.^n;He wants to be your bodyguard, y'know.
AC_CHP_L1_105
But since you're both here, you should train together!
AC_CHP_L1_111
Good. Then from now on, he's your teacher.
AC_CHP_L1_112
Dodomezaki left you so that he could get strong enough^n;to keep you safe.
AC_CHP_L1_113
Yeah, I get that, but why is he my teacher?
AC_CHP_L1_201
You okay? Looks like you're in a tight spot.
AC_CHP_L1_202
Yeah. I can use some help from you and Dodomezaki.
AC_CHP_L1_211
You and Dodomezaki both have potential.
AC_CHP_L1_212
But remember that slow and steady wins the race.^n;Let's call it for today.
vnag401demow_0_chp
You are a most unusual ninja.
vchp400demow_0_nag
You're pretty unique yourself.
AC_CHP_L1_401
Hey, Shrimp. Training's on hold. Go home.
AC_CHP_L1_402
Huh?! But I can help!
AC_CHP_L1_403
Just look at the guy! He's not your run-of-the-mill monster.
AC_CHP_L1_411
A shame. It would seem you can't go all out with a child at your side.
AC_CHP_L1_412
You're more of a gentleman than I expected.^n;Wait, is this a bushido thing?
AC_CHP_L1_413
I'm sorry. I was dragging you down.
AC_CHP_L1_414
...You kidding me? You just saved my life.
AC_CHP_L1_421
Tch. Think you're so high-and-mighty...^n;You're not even taking this seriously!
AC_CHP_L1_422
You misunderstand.^n;I'm just enjoying our bout to the fullest.
AC_CHP_L1_423
But perhaps we'll finish this another day.
vnag401demox_0_chp
You there, shinobi. I challenge you to a duel.
vchp400demox_0_nag
Look, I got places to be.
AC_CHP_L2_401
Uh, he looks pretty tough...
AC_CHP_L2_402
Stay back. He's way out of your league.
AC_CHP_L2_411
Your bladework... Is that Koretou-style?
AC_CHP_L2_412
...Someday, we should really put it to the test.
AC_CHP_L2_413
How does he know Tsuyoshi-style techniques?
AC_CHP_L3_301
So, uh, when are you gonna teach me something?
AC_CHP_L3_302
I used to be just like you.
AC_CHP_L3_311
I see you've gotten stronger, Dodomezaki.
AC_CHP_L3_312
And so have you. Can't you feel it?
AC_CHP_L3_313
All this time you were supporting Dodomezaki,^n;you were rethinking how you did things.
AC_CHP_L3_314
Yeah... Yeah, you're right.
AC_CHP_L3_315
When I was a kid, I was amazed by how^n;much the squirrels of the forest could teach me...
AC_CHP_L3_321
How did you feel, watching Dodomezaki giving his all?
AC_CHP_L3_322
I wanted to step in and help him...^n;But that'd defeat the purpose of his training, wouldn't it?
AC_CHP_L3_323
Exactly. You can't ever really learn something^n;if you don't come to recognize it on your own.
AC_CHP_L3_324
I get it. So Dodomezaki and I are in the same boat...
vnag401demoy_0_chp
Interesting. You have embraced the true way of the ninja.
vchp400demoy_0_nag
That's because my master was a true ninja.
AC_CHP_L3_401
Your martial arts... are they a branch school of the Koretou style?
AC_CHP_L3_402
Tsuyoshi-style. And don't forget it.
vnag401demoz_0_chp
Run, while I still have... control...
vchp400demoz_0_nag
No way. I've still got some questions for you!
AC_CHP_L3_501
How about your sword style?
AC_CHP_L3_502
It's my version of the Koretou style, as taught by Kazusanosuke.
AC_CHP_L3_503
Could that be where the Tsuyoshi style came from?
AC_CHP_L3_504
...Perhaps we'll find out next time.
vpot602demoa_0
Understood. Proceed with the next mission.
vpot602demob_0
Well done. Return to base.
vpot602democ_0
Copy that. Awaiting next report.
vpot400demoa_0
Commencing mission.
vpot400demob_0
With all due respect, I will defeat you.
vpot400democ_0
Contact.
vpot401demoa_0
Push yourself to your very limits.
vpot401demob_0
Think up a way to live through this.
vpot401democ_0
Put your life on the line if you want to proceed!
vpot402demoa_0
Target decommissioned.
vpot402demob_0
Mission accomplished.
vpot402democ_0
Proceeding with the mission as planned.
vpot401demoa_0_pot
If I lost here, then I would be the fake.
vpot400demoa_0_pot
Your spirit alone has earned my respect.
vpot401demob_0_pot
I'm impressed with how well you've replicated my appearance.
vpot400demob_0_pot
Then let our pride be the deciding factor.
vleo401demov_0_pot
Sorry to keep you waiting.
vpot400demov_0_leo
You're telling me you're the special envoy?
AC_POT_L1_101
Didn't think they'd send a king on a capture mission.
AC_POT_L1_102
Your country does have a special forces unit, yes?
AC_POT_L1_103
Only through firsthand knowledge does a king earn his right to rule.
AC_POT_L1_104
Well, that, and my personal biases against coexistence^n;with Gears uniquely qualify me for the position.
AC_POT_L1_105
I see... Very well, commencing search for the target.
AC_POT_L1_111
...Aren't you supposed to be the "Iron Shield of Zepp"?
AC_POT_L1_112
You're an Allied King of Illyria, remember.^n;I'm just a diplomat.
AC_POT_L1_113
Right now, I'm merely your ally.^n;Let's put our titles aside for the moment.
AC_POT_L1_114
I still can't believe you're a part of this mission...
AC_POT_L1_201
Looks like somene needs a hand.
AC_POT_L1_202
Much obliged. They're proving more of a challenge than I anticipated.
AC_POT_L1_211
Don't let your guard down.^n;Humans are not welcome here.
AC_POT_L1_212
Moving in a group may be too risky.^n;Let's split up, lower our profile.
vnag401demow_0_pot
Are you looking for someone?
vpot400demow_0_nag
I've just found him.
AC_POT_L1_401
You think I'll lay down my sword and let you capture me?
AC_POT_L1_402
Hold on, you misunderstand.
AC_POT_L1_403
Speak with your fists. It'll be faster that way.
AC_POT_L1_411
In all my years, this is the first time anyone's ever^n;questioned me about coexistence.
AC_POT_L1_412
It's mankind that's being questioned...^n;about the dawn of a new era.
AC_POT_L1_413
I'm just a relic of the past,^n;left behind by the tides of time.
AC_POT_L1_414
We shall meet again.
AC_POT_L1_421
So you're not here for a hunt after all.
AC_POT_L1_422
Exactly. So will you finally listen?
AC_POT_L1_423
Your fists are mighty, but they lack conviction.^n;The divide goes clear down to your core.
AC_POT_L1_424
Farewell.
vnag401demox_0_pot
Now, this is a rare sight.
vpot400demox_0_nag
You'll get used to it soon enough.
AC_POT_L2_401
You stand before me without a shred of malice.
AC_POT_L2_402
But you can sense my fighting spirit, can you not?
AC_POT_L2_403
The battlefield need not be your home.
AC_POT_L2_411
Stop trying to befriend me.^n;This world does not change so easily.
AC_POT_L2_412
It may not be easy, but it can change.
AC_POT_L2_413
...You say that so casually.
AC_POT_L2_414
Heh. Until we meet again.
AC_POT_L3_301
We've nearly reached our destination.^n;Let's catch our breath.
AC_POT_L3_302
We should be warming up instead.^n;I heard he went toe-to-toe with Sol.
AC_POT_L3_303
If you want to warm up, then you're^n;in luck. My heart is always blazing!
AC_POT_L3_311
...Wasn't that a bit much for just a warm up?
AC_POT_L3_312
Er, Sorry. I'll take you up on that breather now.
AC_POT_L3_313
Maybe scan the area while I'm at it.
AC_POT_L3_321
Now we're ready for anything.
AC_POT_L3_322
Indeed. Let's proceed.
vnag401demoy_0_pot
I like that look in your eyes.
vpot400demoy_0_nag
I'm determined to make you understand.
AC_POT_L3_401
Impressive.
AC_POT_L3_402
My comrade will be here soon.^n;I urge you to what we have to say.
vnag401demoz_0_pot
...I won't be in any state to listen by then.
vpot400demoz_0_nag
Then I guess this is where we get serious.
AC_POT_L3_501
...You can still move?
AC_POT_L3_502
I...hunger.  If this goes on, I will hurt you...
AC_POT_L3_503
So this is what a Nightless is...
vfau400demoa_0
Won't abandon, patients...
vfau400demob_0
No need, for insurance.
vfau400democ_0
Let's take, a look.
vfau401demoa_0
Begin, operation.
vfau401demob_0
At reception, wait.
vfau401democ_0
Replace, everything...
vfau402demoa_0
Take care...
vfau402demob_0
Operation, success.
vfau402democ_0
Next week, same time, same place.
vfau401demoa_0_fau
Isn't it hard, see, with one eye?
vfau400demoa_0_fau
You, think so too?
vfau401demob_0_fau
More doctors, the better.
vfau400demob_0_fau
Let's, both, peer review...
vfau402demoa_0_fau
Save more, together.
vfau401demoa_0_gld
First, make reservation.
vfau400demoa_0_gld
Interview, skip.
vfau402demoa_0_gld
Change, lifestyle habits.
vram401demov_0_fau
Unlicensed doctoring is illegal.
vfau400demov_0_ram
...Arresting me?
AC_FAU_L1_101
I'll save, demi-human.
AC_FAU_L1_102
You're strong. No, kind...
AC_FAU_L1_111
My goal is to secure the demi-human. I have no interest in you.
AC_FAU_L1_112
Secure...
AC_FAU_L1_201
Watch out. The way you walk is... odd.
AC_FAU_L1_202
Original style.
AC_FAU_L1_211
You, go home.
AC_FAU_L1_212
Fighting... No good.
AC_FAU_L1_213
I don't know why, but I think you're right.
AC_FAU_L1_214
All right.
vnag401demow_0_fau
I have no use for a doctor.
vfau400demow_0_nag
First, let's take a look.
AC_FAU_L1_401
Why are you following me?
AC_FAU_L1_402
...Help.
AC_FAU_L1_403
I don't need it.
AC_FAU_L1_404
Not you. Demi-human.
AC_FAU_L1_411
You... Too strong. That's why you're weak.
AC_FAU_L1_412
...You're right. That weakness is why I always end up hurting someone.
AC_FAU_L1_413
What did you do?
AC_FAU_L1_414
Just took a look. Arrest me?
AC_FAU_L1_415
No... I won't arrest you. You can help people.
AC_FAU_L1_421
You've diagnosed-- No, you've seen through me.
AC_FAU_L1_422
But my affliction is one I must face alone. Stay out of it.
AC_FAU_L1_423
It's okay, to ask for help.
vnag401demox_0_fau
Can you not sense my malice?
vfau400demox_0_nag
No, malice.
AC_FAU_L2_401
Let's fight. With my swords...and your heart.
AC_FAU_L2_402
Will reach him.
AC_FAU_L2_411
You're strong... Or, no... Perhaps I'm weak.
AC_FAU_L2_412
No. That is, underlying strength.
AC_FAU_L2_413
...Impressive.
AC_FAU_L3_301
You're strange. What made you like this?
AC_FAU_L3_302
Went back, to old focus... Saving lives. Went back too far...
AC_FAU_L3_303
It's still illegal, you know.
AC_FAU_L3_311
You're strong. But I can tell... you're hurt inside.
AC_FAU_L3_312
Tell me... who's going to save you?
AC_FAU_L3_313
I, save me.
AC_FAU_L3_314
Finally found, my answer.
AC_FAU_L3_315
...I think it would be better to leave the demi-human to you.
AC_FAU_L3_321
...You're really strong.
AC_FAU_L3_322
Are you,injured?
AC_FAU_L3_323
I'm fine. We'll go to him together.
vnag401demoy_0_fau
Approach me at your own peril.
vfau400demoy_0_nag
No need, to fear.
AC_FAU_L3_401
Self-hate, no.
AC_FAU_L3_402
World, is vast.
vnag401demoz_0_fau
No, it's too vast... Now run.
vfau400demoz_0_nag
Can't cure, if run.
AC_FAU_L3_501
...Why did you purposefully give me an opening?
AC_FAU_L3_502
Your conviction, I cannot cut.
AC_FAU_L3_503
Praise yourself.
AC_FAU_L3_504
You mean to say that you trusted me?
vmll400demoa_0
Win before you bark.
vmll400demob_0
Such confidence.
vmll400democ_0
Think you can catch me?
vmll401demoa_0
You won't even have the time to blink.
vmll401demob_0
You can run... I won't mind.
vmll401democ_0
I'll make this painless.
vmll402demoa_0
You should pay more attention...
vmll402demob_0
You really weren't that bad, I guess.
vmll402democ_0
Sweet dreams.
vmll400demoa_0_zat
You're right. Here's an order: spar with me.
vmll401demoa_0_zat
Time for some employee evaluation.
vmll402demoa_0_zat
You'll have to be stronger than that if you want to protect me.
vmll400demoa_0_leo
Sure, but you might want to start brainstorming.
vmll401demoa_0_leo
Should I roll out the red carpet?
vmll402demoa_0_leo
I'm going to need a report when you wake up.
vzat401demov_0_mll
To what do I owe this sudden summons?
vmll400demov_0_zat
An order. Fight me with all you've got.
AC_MLL_L1_101
*sigh* I thought as much. You always hold back at the critical moment.
AC_MLL_L1_102
I think you're well aware of my full strength by now.
AC_MLL_L1_103
But are you well aware of mine?
AC_MLL_L1_111
It may not have been all I've got, but it should be close enough.
AC_MLL_L1_112
Don't you get it? You can follow orders all day long,^n;but you have no idea how to protect me.
AC_MLL_L1_113
...And that's because you don't try to learn.
AC_MLL_L1_201
What did you mean by what you said earlier?
AC_MLL_L1_202
If you want to know so badly, then help me.
AC_MLL_L1_211
Can anything be gained through such a victory?
AC_MLL_L1_212
No. We need a stronger opponent.
AC_MLL_L1_213
You can head back now.
vnag401demow_0_mll
Take your leave at once.
vmll400demow_0_nag
Oh, my. Since when was it your private property?
AC_MLL_L1_401
I don't believe in drawing my sword against women.
AC_MLL_L1_402
What a gentleman. But that's an old-fashioned way of thinking.
AC_MLL_L1_403
If it's a man you want, then you can face us both.
AC_MLL_L1_411
...Impressive.
AC_MLL_L1_412
We survived.
AC_MLL_L1_413
I could have handled him on my own, but...thanks.
AC_MLL_L1_414
Though I think we'll need more time.
AC_MLL_L1_421
So this is not where I meet my death after all.
AC_MLL_L1_422
A win's a win. That's everything in my world.
AC_MLL_L1_423
Hmm. We shall meet again.
vnag401demox_0_mll
That man by your side... He wields a Forbidden Beast.
vmll400demox_0_nag
Now, now. Ladies first.
AC_MLL_L2_401
Millia, he's a truly formidable opponent.
AC_MLL_L2_402
Then I order you to protect me.
AC_MLL_L2_403
With pleasure.
AC_MLL_L2_411
...Impressive.
AC_MLL_L2_412
Have I fulfilled my role as your knight?
AC_MLL_L2_413
Not until I'm old, gray, and on my deathbed.
AC_MLL_L3_301
I've thought things over.^n;Let's fight once more, with nothing held back.
AC_MLL_L3_302
Is that a promise?
AC_MLL_L3_311
Seems like you finally get it.
AC_MLL_L3_312
I've tried to protect you for all this time.^n;but I never truly understood your strength.
AC_MLL_L3_313
You've passed. As my one and only knight should.
AC_MLL_L3_321
You understand now, don't you?.
AC_MLL_L3_322
I do... Though I'm afraid I didn't quite measure up to your expectations.
AC_MLL_L3_323
Then I'll give you one more chance.
vnag401demoy_0_mll
Such malice hardly befits a woman.
vmll400demoy_0_nag
You'd be malicious too if you were facing down a man with a sword.
AC_MLL_L3_401
To think you were a Forbidden Beast wielder...
AC_MLL_L3_402
Was I supposed to warn you beforehand?
vnag401demoz_0_mll
Yes, you should have.
vmll400demoz_0_nag
...He's going berserk? How can he get stronger?!
AC_MLL_L3_501
...Impressive.
AC_MLL_L3_502
Let's just hope we never meet again.
vzat400demoa_0
Show me what you've got...
vzat400demob_0
This is pointless.
vzat400democ_0
Let us begin.
vzat401demoa_0
I'll show you a darkness deeper than death.
vzat401demob_0
My name is Zato-1...
vzat401democ_0
I'm here to scout you.
vzat402demoa_0
I'm bringing you back with me.
vzat402demob_0
From now on, I'm your boss.
vzat402democ_0
Congratulations, you work for the government now.
vzat400demoa_0_mll
You already know every inch of me, do you not?
vzat401demoa_0_mll
You should start acting more managerial.
vzat402demoa_0_mll
I can't call myself your knight if I lose to you.
vzat401demoa_0_zat
Do you even care?
vzat400demoa_0_zat
I can't say I do.
vzat401demob_0_zat
Am I the imposter?
vzat400demob_0_zat
No, it could be me.
vzat402demoa_0_zat
We were both strong.
vzat402demoa_0_nag
Where did you learn your Dandyism?
vmll401demov_0_zat
Let's begin your assessment.
vzat400demov_0_mll
Are you unhappy with my performance?
AC_ZAT_L1_101
Will that do?
AC_ZAT_L1_102
If I were assessing a new recruit, maybe.^n;You have no idea what I'm looking for, do you?
AC_ZAT_L1_111
What are you doing?
AC_ZAT_L1_112
I have no desire to fight you any longer.
AC_ZAT_L1_113
Did you think I called you out here for a workout?^n;Oh, forget it. I'm not getting through to you anyway.
AC_ZAT_L1_201
Don't tell me what I said earlier got to you...
AC_ZAT_L1_202
I hate to admit it, but yes. I haven't been able^n;to focus on combat because of it.
AC_ZAT_L1_211
That's enough for today. I'm heading back.
AC_ZAT_L1_212
This wasn't the outcome I was hoping for,^n;but it wasn't all bad.
AC_ZAT_L1_213
You need to better understand your weaknesses.
vnag401demow_0_zat
You're a warmonger, are you not?
vzat400demow_0_nag
Close enough.
AC_ZAT_L1_401
Now this looks like a formidable opponent.
AC_ZAT_L1_402
Go back, Millia. I fear I may not be able to protect you.
AC_ZAT_L1_403
That's where you're mistaken.
AC_ZAT_L1_411
...Impressive.
AC_ZAT_L1_412
Even working together, we couldn't take him down...
AC_ZAT_L1_413
We could have if we'd really worked together.
AC_ZAT_L1_414
?
AC_ZAT_L1_421
A shame. Though you're certainly strong enough...
AC_ZAT_L1_422
Keep yourself focused on our battle next time we face off.
AC_ZAT_L1_423
...It's true. Though my body was in battle,^n;my mind was stuck on Millia's words.
vnag401demox_0_zat
What a peculiar encounter. Let us battle.
vzat400demox_0_nag
You're no ordinary brigand yourself.
AC_ZAT_L2_401
I've lived a long life, and even I've never faced two^n;Forbidden Beast wielders at once.
AC_ZAT_L2_402
So you follow the code of a warrior,^n;I sense not a shred of conceit.
AC_ZAT_L2_403
In other words, he's the ideal opponent.
AC_ZAT_L2_411
...Impressive.
AC_ZAT_L2_412
We barely survived.^n;Had I been focused on protecting you,^n;we very likely would not have made it.
AC_ZAT_L2_413
That's how it should be.^n;That's what it means to be partners.
AC_ZAT_L3_301
You're looking pretty good.
AC_ZAT_L3_302
I think I now understand what you're after.
AC_ZAT_L3_303
No need to put it into words.^n;Let me feel it.
AC_ZAT_L3_311
Only by supporting each other^n;can we unleash our full strength.
AC_ZAT_L3_312
In order to protect you,^n;I need to have faith in you.
AC_ZAT_L3_313
Congratulations, you passed.^n;Just don't go back to babysitting me.
AC_ZAT_L3_321
...Well, I suppose you pass... barely.
AC_ZAT_L3_322
You're only aware of your own limits.
AC_ZAT_L3_323
Yes... But for us to work at our best,^n;I need to be aware of yours as well.
vnag401demoy_0_zat
A user of the mind's eye? How curious.
vzat400demoy_0_nag
Let me show you something even curiouser.
AC_ZAT_L3_401
Such power... Is that a Forbidden Beast?
AC_ZAT_L3_402
I'm not proud of it, but...
vzat400demoz_0_nag
No way...? You look far curiouser than I am.
vnag401demoz_0_zat
Run. If you understand my power, then you know what's coming.
AC_ZAT_L3_501
Impressive...
AC_ZAT_L3_502
A Nightless... Could he be connected to Lord Slayer?
vram400demoa_0
If you're done talking, let's begin.
vram400demob_0
I'll see for myself what you mean.
vram400democ_0
I'll do my best. Really.
vram401demoa_0
I'll create... the future.
vram401demob_0
What makes you "unique"?
vram401democ_0
Commencing assessment of the target.
vram402demoa_0
We can go home now. Let's go.
vram402demob_0
I didn't win anything. I'm just strong.
vram402democ_0
This meant something, but I don't know what. So I'll keep going.
vram400demoa_0_leo
So cool...
vram401demoa_0_leo
Please praise me if I do well.
vram401demoa_0_ram
I won't reject you.
vram400demoa_0_ram
Thank you.
vram401demob_0_ram
I won't deny myself.
vram400demob_0_ram
Then we can both accept each other.
vram651demoa_1_sin
I was saving something... Where'd it go?
vram650demoa_1_sin
I'm ready, too. Tell me if it hurts.
vram401demoa_1_bed
Begin suppression operation.
vram400demoa_1_bed
Thank you. I'll do my best.
vfau401demov_0_ram
Stop, running...
vram400demov_0_fau
Stop chasing me then.
AC_RAM_L1_101
My mission is to secure the demi-human.^n;There'll be more danger ahead.
AC_RAM_L1_102
That's why, follow.
AC_RAM_L1_111
Do not fight, demi-human.
AC_RAM_L1_112
But that's my mission.
AC_RAM_L1_113
Mission, can't complete.
AC_RAM_L1_201
Help, you.
AC_RAM_L1_202
...Thank you.
AC_RAM_L1_211
What do you mean, I cannot complete my mission?
AC_RAM_L1_212
You'll lose, even if you win.
AC_RAM_L1_213
I see.
AC_RAM_L1_214
Thank you, but I'll be fine.
vnag401demow_0_ram
You're with the government?
vram400demow_0_nag
Yes, but not really.
AC_RAM_L1_401
This doctor told me...
AC_RAM_L1_402
Business, cannot win...
AC_RAM_L1_403
That's certainly one way to put it.
AC_RAM_L1_411
What are you trying to achieve by capturing me?
AC_RAM_L1_412
I won't capture you. We want to bring your heart back with us.
AC_RAM_L1_413
My heart?
AC_RAM_L1_414
We want to become somewhere you belong.
AC_RAM_L1_415
I don't get a place like that.
AC_RAM_L1_421
Challenging me half-heartedly is asking for death.
AC_RAM_L1_422
Why haven't you defeated me, then?
AC_RAM_L1_423
You can't win like this.
AC_RAM_L1_424
You're stronger than I expected, I'll give you that. But you must leave me be.
vnag401demox_0_ram
Do I look like someone who belongs?
vram400demox_0_nag
Do you not think so?
AC_RAM_L2_401
If you win, you lose.
AC_RAM_L2_402
I understand, but that doesn't mean we should go easy on him.
AC_RAM_L2_411
You aren't trying to win. Why?
AC_RAM_L2_412
Are you trying to placate me?
AC_RAM_L2_413
"Placate"? I don't know difficult words like that.
AC_RAM_L2_414
But I will neither win, nor lose.
AC_RAM_L2_415
I just want to get my message across.
AC_RAM_L2_416
...Perhaps a day will come when I can believe it.
AC_RAM_L3_301
Define, secure...
AC_RAM_L3_302
It's hard to put into words. Fight me.
AC_RAM_L3_311
If you keep getting rid of unnecessary things...
AC_RAM_L3_312
Your world becomes smaller and loses color. And before long...
AC_RAM_L3_313
You become smaller, too.
AC_RAM_L3_314
To protect yourself, help demi-human.
AC_RAM_L3_315
...I'll support.
AC_RAM_L3_321
...You, will not capture demi-human.
AC_RAM_L3_322
I just want him to know. Not my words... but my feelings.
AC_RAM_L3_323
Help, let me.
vnag401demoy_0_ram
Beneath your calm exterior, I sense a mighty will.
vram400demoy_0_nag
I accept that.
AC_RAM_L3_401
...You're strong.
AC_RAM_L3_402
Yes, I am strong.
vnag401demoz_0_ram
But you're not giving this your all. You cannot defeat me.
vram400demoz_0_nag
I never intended to defeat you.
AC_RAM_L3_501
What are you trying to make me do?
AC_RAM_L3_502
I want you to accept yourself.
AC_RAM_L3_503
But that's hard to do all alone.
AC_RAM_L3_504
I know. It's why I've hurt so many people. Too many.
AC_RAM_L3_505
You won't hurt me. Because I'm strong.
vleo400demoa_0
Are you fine with such words as your last?
vleo400demob_0
A silent victory's worth more than any pretty speech.
vleo400democ_0
I will rise above everything in my way.
vleo401demoa_0
A fool who doesn't fear me, huh?
vleo401demob_0
Oh, I'm not strong. I'm ABSURDLY strong!
vleo401democ_0
Rejoice. You'll be the definition of "Loser" in my dictionary.
vleo402demoa_0
You've fought well against me. Now rest.
vleo402demob_0
The reason you lost is you've fought against me.
vleo402democ_0
Only two things in this world are insurmountable^n;A mother's recipe and my genius.
vleo400demoa_0_kyk
I'm not the one spending all his time behind a desk.
vleo401demoa_0_kyk
This one's for the title of "Genius."
vleo402demoa_0_kyk
Call the media. I want this win on the front page tomorrow morning.
vleo400demoa_0_mll
I'm your boss. Respect me, but don't flatter me.
vleo401demoa_0_mll
No need to think up excuses, it's only natural that I'll win.
vleo402demoa_0_mll
Focus on recovery if you have any strength left.
vleo401demoa_0_leo
Pretty good for an imposter.
vleo400demoa_0_leo
Ridiculous.
vleo401demob_0_leo
Rejoice, for you'll learn what you lack as an impersonator.
vleo400demob_0_leo
The genuine article has nothing to learn.
vleo402demoa_0_leo
Continue to impersonate me if you wish.^n;The existence of a counterfeit only raises the value of the genuine article.
vleo400demoa_0_ram
Challenge me, and I'll praise you regardless.
vleo401demoa_0_ram
Whether a miracle or Lady Luck, nothing may stand against me.
vleo400demoa_0_sin

vleo401demoa_0_sin

vpot401demov_0_leo
An Allied King, out on surveillance?
vleo400demov_0_pot
I needed to see the truth with my own eyes.
AC_LEO_L1_101
You're as highly skilled as I'd expected.
AC_LEO_L1_102
Haha. By all means, keep the compliments coming.^n;But let's go over our mission, first.
AC_LEO_L1_103
This is a joint operation to secure the demi-human.
AC_LEO_L1_104
That's right. And it may get violent.^n;Do not let your guard down.
AC_LEO_L1_111
...Is Illyria lacking manpower?
AC_LEO_L1_112
That was just a warm-up!
AC_LEO_L1_113
The operation will now commence!^n;Let us secure the demi-human.
AC_LEO_L1_201
We still have a long way to go.^n;Remember to conserve your strength.
AC_LEO_L1_202
Conserve your worries!^n;My stamina is endless!
AC_LEO_L1_211
Quit being stubborn and get some rest.^n;I'll go on ahead to scout the area.
AC_LEO_L1_212
Sure. But do not engage the demi-human alone^n;even if you encounter him!
vnag401demow_0_leo
Go home, before you get hurt.
vleo400demow_0_nag
Fine, but only if you come with us.
AC_LEO_L1_401
Did you think you could win by ganging up on me?
AC_LEO_L1_402
I know I could win with one hand behind my back!
AC_LEO_L1_403
Leo, his strength is no mere boast!
AC_LEO_L1_411
Weak. You'll never kill me like this.
AC_LEO_L1_412
There's no entry for "eradication" in my dictionary.^n;It's way cooler to unite with someone, after all.
AC_LEO_L1_413
You are one strange man.^n;But the will in your eyes is strong.
AC_LEO_L1_414
...We shall meet again.
AC_LEO_L1_421
Stop. Continuing this battle will only wear you down.
AC_LEO_L1_422
That's going in my dictionary under "Lame Excuses."
AC_LEO_L1_423
How odd. I see neither fear nor greed in your eyes.
AC_LEO_L1_424
...Don't try getting friendly with me.
vnag401demox_0_leo
You aren't just some snob, it would seem.
vleo400demox_0_nag
I'm actually a king.
AC_LEO_L2_401
A beast will not bare its fangs if its nest is undisturbed.
AC_LEO_L2_402
But it will be hunted down once it does.
AC_LEO_L2_403
Even if the fault lies in the whim of some foolish man.^n;We wanted to talk to you before that could happen.
AC_LEO_L2_411
Spare me.^n;I serve only one master.
AC_LEO_L2_412
Though he has already departed this world,^n;a samurai's loyalty never waivers.
AC_LEO_L2_413
Work with us, then... not for us.
AC_LEO_L2_414
A king does not demand servitude,^n;but proves himself worthy of it.
AC_LEO_L2_415
We both know the meaning of loyalty.
AC_LEO_L2_416
...A king, huh?
AC_LEO_L3_301
According to our intel, he should be^n;hiding somewhere nearby.
AC_LEO_L3_302
We should get warmed up, then.
AC_LEO_L3_303
My thoughts exactly.
AC_LEO_L3_311
That's enough. Any more and it will impact^n;our performance later.
AC_LEO_L3_312
All right then, you take a break.^n;I'll keep pushing ahead.
AC_LEO_L3_321
That should do.
AC_LEO_L3_322
Yeah, I'm all ready to go.
vnag401demoy_0_leo
Such spirit. Been a while since I've^n;faced an opponent like you.
vleo400demoy_0_nag
Oh, you've NEVER faced an opponent like me!
AC_LEO_L3_401
I see... So you honed your sword skills on the battlefield.
AC_LEO_L3_402
You're not the only one who's well-acquainted with death.
vnag401demoz_0_leo
...But run, if you don't want this place to be your grave.
vleo400demoz_0_nag
I've nothing to gain by fleeing or dying.^n;Therefore, my sole option is to win!
AC_LEO_L3_501
I know what you're planning.^n;You intend to tame and make use of me.
AC_LEO_L3_502
What's wrong with that?^n;We're all bound to our own interests.
AC_LEO_L3_503
What matters is whether or not we can^n;call the ties that bind us "trust."
AC_LEO_L3_504
Trust.
AC_LEO_L3_505
I'm not entirely sure the word belongs on my lips.
vnag400demoa_0
No words are needed in a duel.
vnag400demob_0
Let me answer you with my sword.
vnag400democ_0
I'll listen to whatever you have to say after the battle.
vnag401demoa_0
My name is Nagoriyuki. Let's begin.
vnag401demob_0
As a retainer of Kazusanosuke, I will face you.
vnag401democ_0
Let us duel.
vnag402demoa_0
Rest now, lest your wounds open up.
vnag402demob_0
Do not wallow in defeat. Take pride that you did your best.
vnag402democ_0
Disappointing. With more training, you may have stood a chance.
vnag400demoa_0_sol
Do you know my master?
vnag401demoa_0_sol
Accursed monster.
vnag402demoa_0_sol
Refine your skill. You're overreliant on your strength.
vnag400demoa_0_chp
I'd ask the same of you.
vnag401demoa_0_chp
How do you know Tsuyoshi?
vnag402demoa_0_zat
It would seem you do not fully grasp the meaning of "Dandyism."
vnag401demoa_0_nag
Only a fool treads the path of the demon lightly.
vnag400demoa_0_nag
Heed your own warning, fool.
vnag400demoa_0_gio
I look forward to it.
vnag401demoa_0_gio
A feral one, aren't you?
vnag401demoa_0_cos
I cannot let you leave here alive.
vnag400demoa_0_cos
All's well, so long as you're gone.
vnag402demoa_0_cos
You've lost, yet you still laugh. Accursed beast.
vnag400demoa_0_bkn
A taller order than I can fulfill.
vnag401demoa_0_bkn
If you'll teach, I will learn.
vzat401demov_0_nag
There's something I'd like to ask you.
vnag400demov_0_zat
Likewise. Shall we?
AC_NAG_L1_101
As I thought... You're no ordinary vampire samurai.
AC_NAG_L1_102
I see the roots of Dandyism within you, as well.
AC_NAG_L1_103
That being said, I've just awoken from a long night's rest...^n;It seems my mind has yet to clear.
AC_NAG_L1_104
Then until it does, allow me to accompany you in your training.
AC_NAG_L1_111
Perhaps I was mistaken.^n;I was quite sure that we had something in common.
AC_NAG_L1_112
Forgive me. I allowed my thoughts to stray from our duel.
AC_NAG_L1_113
Perhaps you should assess me once more.
AC_NAG_L1_201
You must have been asleep for quite some time.^n;Your wits are not entirely about you.
AC_NAG_L1_202
What an embarrassment...
AC_NAG_L1_211
It would seem as though I'm not what you need to return to full strength.
AC_NAG_L1_212
I'll be a mere observer from here on.
vnag401demow_0_nag
(We meet again.)
vnag400demow_0_nag
Though I'd rather we didn't.
AC_NAG_L1_401
(Your heart is as fragile as ever.)
AC_NAG_L1_402
I can see it too... What a vexing nuisance.
AC_NAG_L1_403
It seems my resolve is still lacking.
AC_NAG_L1_411
(Heh heh... I guess that's enough for today.)
AC_NAG_L1_412
I'm sorry I couldn't be much help
AC_NAG_L1_413
No, this is all my own weakness.
AC_NAG_L1_414
I'll have to accept that.
AC_NAG_L1_421
(The moment you lose focus is the moment I return.)
AC_NAG_L1_422
Then I'll cut you down as many times as it takes.
vnag401demox_0_nag
(Accept me, at once.)
vnag400demox_0_nag
I do accept you. I simply refuse to give in.
AC_NAG_L2_401
So this is the darkness within you.
AC_NAG_L2_402
Careful. My inner demons are known to take shape.
AC_NAG_L2_403
I must say, this goes beyond what I had imagined.
AC_NAG_L2_411
(Weak. So weak.)
AC_NAG_L2_412
That's why I continue to fight.^n;There's no need to tell me what I already know.
AC_NAG_L2_413
Now that the battle is over, we've time to spare.^n;Come, let us visit Lord Slayer together.
AC_NAG_L3_301
We're almost there. You're so close to remembering^n;what you've forgotten.
AC_NAG_L3_302
And I thank you for that.
AC_NAG_L3_311
I see... Your Bushido and your Dandyism work in harmony.
AC_NAG_L3_312
Unfortunately, the battle ahead is one you must face alone.^n;I cannot assist you.
AC_NAG_L3_313
You've done more than enough.^n;Once I've returned to full strength, I do hope I can face you again.
AC_NAG_L3_321
Masterful. It would seem you no longer require my help.
AC_NAG_L3_322
On the contrary. This mess I'm in is born of my own shortcomings.
AC_NAG_L3_323
But I will perfect them.
vnag401demoy_0_nag
(We are one in the same. You cannot be rid of me.)
vnag400demoy_0_nag
That doesn't mean I can't cut you down.
AC_NAG_L3_401
(Heh heh heh... Is that all you're cabable of?!)
AC_NAG_L3_402
Maybe so. But it's still more than you are.
vnag401demoz_0_nag
(Resolve will never trumph over instinct.)
vnag400demoz_0_nag
If one submits, it's isn't true resolve.
AC_NAG_L3_501
(...Do you intend to thirst for the rest of eternity?)
AC_NAG_L3_502
I gave my answer long ago. I've no words left for you.
vgio400demoa_0
Yeah, don't care. Can we just do this?
vgio400demob_0
Have you been practicing that one?
vgio400democ_0
Wow, cool.
vgio401demoa_0
I'll neutralize you.
vgio401demob_0
Can we get this over with?
vgio401democ_0
Okay, let's assess your threat level.
vgio600a_0
"Not finishing him off?"
vgio600a_1
"Not finishing her off?"
vgio600b_0
"That wasn't so easy, huh?"
vgio600b_1
"That wasn't so easy, huh?"
vgio600c_0
"Can I eat him?"
vgio600c_1
"Can I eat her?"
vgio402demoa_0
What, you hungry?
vgio402demob_0
True, but a jaguar cub might be stronger.
vgio402democ_0
Hey, no, this isn't Iguazu, y'know.
vgio400demoa_0_nag
You looking for a fight?
vgio401demoa_0_nag
If you die, I apologize.
vgio400demoa_0_leo
You're just my type.
vgio401demoa_0_leo
Can I drag you home with me?
vgio402demoa_0_leo
We can't take him home if you do that.
vgio402demob_0_leo
Yeah, he's got me kinda mesmerized.
vgio402democ_0_leo
No,'cause I'm gonna eat him.
vgio400demoa_0_gld
This won't go on my record, will it?
vgio401demoa_0_gld
Mind taking it easy on me?
vgio401demoa_0_gio
A doppel-whatever?
vgio400demoa_0_gio
You mean me, or you?
vgio401demob_0_gio
Maybe we're twins, separated at birth.
vgio400demob_0_gio
Maybe? Who's the little sister?
vaxl401demov_0_gio
Looks like you wanna ask me something.
vgio400demov_0_axl
Only if you know the directions.
AC_GIO_L1_101
Lookin' for the samurai, eh?
AC_GIO_L1_102
I suppose you know I wanna kick his ass, too.^n;Guess I won't be getting those directions.
AC_GIO_L1_103
Well, you're not the only one who picks up on things.^n;Forget I ever asked.
AC_GIO_L1_111
I know you've got business with that samurai...
AC_GIO_L1_112
But I can't lead you to him. I can sense what^n;you're after, and it isn't good.
AC_GIO_L1_113
Fine then. I'll search for him on my own.
AC_GIO_L1_201
Y'know, you seemed stronger when you were kicking my arse...
AC_GIO_L1_202
I was sure you'd come to my rescue.
AC_GIO_L1_211
You lost on purpose, didn't you?
AC_GIO_L1_212
I had to see if you were stalking me or not.
AC_GIO_L1_213
Don't put it like that...
AC_GIO_L1_214
If you're gonna try to stop me... don't.
vnag401demow_0_gio
You're the wild one from before.
vgio400demow_0_nag
And I'm here to finish you off.
AC_GIO_L1_401
I knew you were gonna fight him!
AC_GIO_L1_402
Uh, please stay outta the way.
AC_GIO_L1_403
I don't mind. I can take the both of you on.
AC_GIO_L1_411
Do you really think I'm here to neutralize this samurai?
AC_GIO_L1_412
...You're not?
AC_GIO_L1_413
If you're not here to fight, I'll take my leave.
AC_GIO_L1_414
Ughhhh...
AC_GIO_L1_421
What were you trying to convey to me through this battle?
AC_GIO_L1_422
Didn't I make it obvious? The two of us are so similar.
AC_GIO_L1_423
Well, if you're ever looking for a job, just let me know.
AC_GIO_L1_424
...Similar, huh.
vnag401demox_0_gio
I felt your anger from leagues away.
vgio400demox_0_nag
Then you know why I'm here.
AC_GIO_L2_401
It just doesn't feel right gangin' up on one guy.
AC_GIO_L2_402
Who cares? Let's do it.
AC_GIO_L2_403
Hah, that's actually refreshing to hear.
AC_GIO_L2_411
What answer were you hoping this battle would offer you?
AC_GIO_L2_412
The one to the question, "What if you could be human again"?
AC_GIO_L2_413
But I know there's no simple answer to that... for any of us here.
AC_GIO_L2_414
Well, yeah. It's not easy to shed off a lifetime of sin.
AC_GIO_L2_415
So I'll keep it simple. Here's my card.
AC_GIO_L2_416
Give me a call when you're having trouble puting food on the table.
AC_GIO_L3_301
Just what do you plan to do with him?
AC_GIO_L3_302
Fight him.
AC_GIO_L3_303
Right, dumb question. But just wait a tick, okay?
AC_GIO_L3_311
Look, I get that you're worried, but I think we're after the same thing here.
AC_GIO_L3_312
I think you're right. Sorry I got you so wrong.
AC_GIO_L3_313
Guess this is what it means to communicate through battle.
AC_GIO_L3_314
So, can you trust me to see this through?
AC_GIO_L3_321
I see, You're actually...
AC_GIO_L3_322
Well, yes. Our methods might be different, but...
AC_GIO_L3_323
You're gonna save him, eh? I'll go with you, then.
vnag401demoy_0_gio
You're in good health, wild one.
vgio400demoy_0_nag
I've gotta be, to kick your ass.
AC_GIO_L3_401
This fighting spirit... You intend to save me?
AC_GIO_L3_402
Good. Glad I got through to you.
vnag401demoz_0_gio
Will you be able able to say the same once you've seen the abyss within me?
vgio400demoz_0_nag
Oh, don't be so dramatic. I saw that the first time we met.
AC_GIO_L3_501
...I'm far past saving.
AC_GIO_L3_502
I said the same thing, a few years back.
AC_GIO_L3_503
I was living in a ruined shack with some old man I didn't even know,^n;wearing clothes I picked up off the street.
AC_GIO_L3_504
Everything can change.
AC_GIO_L3_505
Perhaps. But only once I change myself.
vanj400demoa_0
Think you'll be able to hit me?
vanj400demob_0
Bit early for grandstanding, no?
vanj400democ_0
You'll be playing my foil, right?
vanj401demoa_0
The motto's flawlessness in victory.
vanj401demob_0
This'll be done by the first curtain.
vanj401democ_0
Start thinking up an excuse.
vanj402demoa_0
My dance is unparalleled.
vanj402demob_0
And so the curtain falls.
vanj402democ_0
I'll dance with you any time.
vanj400demoa_0_chp
And that's why I'm taking you down.
vanj401demoa_0_chp
No hard feelings, Boss.
vanj401demoa_0_anj
I earned the name Anji. Did you?
vanj400demoa_0_anj
Let us see who wears it better.
vanj401demob_0_anj
You've got a keen eye, I'll give you that.
vanj400demob_0_anj
What about you? Can you follow me?
vanj402demoa_0_anj
And an understudy you remain.
vanj400demoa_0_bkn
Be gentle, now.
vanj401demoa_0_bkn
May I let loose a little?
vanj402demoa_0_bkn
Are you falling for me?
vanj651demoa_0_cos
I may be the only one who knows the extent of your wrongdoings.
vanj650demoa_0_cos
You're not... exactly what I'd imagined, though.
vanj400demoa_0_ask
Sorry. Old habits die hard.
vanj400demob_0_ask
Something? More like everything!
vanj400democ_0_ask
If you're up to something, let me in on it!
vanj401demoa_0_ask
Look at us, dancing like this.
vanj401demob_0_ask
Hey there, handsome.
vanj401democ_0_ask
No agreement necessary, right?
vanj402demoa_0_ask
You need more training. Are you eating right?
vanj652demoa_0_bed
Don't tell Baiken about this!
vanj652demoa_0_chp
I'm liking your vibes, Boss!
vanj652demoa_0_ino
Forget technique--you have no elegance.
vanj652demoa_0_pot
Your lifestyle's too hardcore for me. But you keep at it!
vchp401demov_0_anj
Come on, hurry it up.
vanj400demov_0_chp
You'd better have a good explanation for this.
AC_ANJ_L1_101
What is this ritual anyway?
AC_ANJ_L1_102
The guy we're after isn't even human.^n;We can't bring him back if we half-ass this.
AC_ANJ_L1_103
Stop trying to act cool, Boss.^n;I can tell how excited you are.
AC_ANJ_L1_104
Hell yeah, I am! He's a samurai!^n;Of course I wanna be friends with a samural!
AC_ANJ_L1_105
Well, to be perfectly frank...
AC_ANJ_L1_106
So do I!
AC_ANJ_L1_107
YEAH!
AC_ANJ_L1_108
Now let's go!
AC_ANJ_L1_111
Stop messin' around.^n;Where's your spirit?
AC_ANJ_L1_112
You're the one who's messing around.^n;My spirits are as high as they've ever been!
AC_ANJ_L1_113
Cuz we're about to meet a samurai!
AC_ANJ_L1_114
Cuz we're about to meet a samurai!
AC_ANJ_L1_115
Okay, come on!
AC_ANJ_L1_116
Right behind you!
AC_ANJ_L1_201
You tryin' to get left behind?
AC_ANJ_L1_202
Oh, pipe down and lend me a hand.
AC_ANJ_L1_211
Miiighta gone a little overboard.^n;We can take a break, if you want.
AC_ANJ_L1_212
I appreciate the gesture, but^n;there's not a chance, Boss.
AC_ANJ_L1_213
From here on out, it's a race to see who gets there first.
AC_ANJ_L1_214
Hahaha. Bring it on, then!
vnag401demow_0_anj
You look familiar.
vanj400demow_0_nag
So you remember. I'm honored.
AC_ANJ_L1_401
Hey, join us.
AC_ANJ_L1_402
You're really gonna lead with that?
AC_ANJ_L1_403
Your shinobi friend's been here before.
AC_ANJ_L1_404
So you intend to make me a tool of the government?
AC_ANJ_L1_405
Doesn't sound half bad. But first, a chambara!
AC_ANJ_L1_411
What fools. Are you really unafraid of me?
AC_ANJ_L1_412
Would you be afraid if you had the chance to^n;meet Miyamoto Musashi?
AC_ANJ_L1_413
Heh heh heh...
AC_ANJ_L1_414
I would be afraid.^n;Afraid that he might start rambling about his paintings!
AC_ANJ_L1_415
Argh. It seems we've missed our mark.
AC_ANJ_L1_416
This time, maybe. We'll be back.
AC_ANJ_L1_417
Yeah.
AC_ANJ_L1_421
You've thrown me for a loop. What a dance.
AC_ANJ_L1_422
Liked it, did you?
AC_ANJ_L1_423
Haha, perhaps. Come visit me again.
AC_ANJ_L1_424
...Wait. I didn't even get to talk to him.
AC_ANJ_L1_425
And for that matter...^n;Where on earth has the boss gone?
vnag401demox_0_anj
Why are you here?
vanj400demox_0_nag
To bring you back.
AC_ANJ_L2_401
Whoa. He's a bona-fide samurai...
AC_ANJ_L2_402
Yeah, the more I look at him,^n;the more incredible he gets...
AC_ANJ_L2_403
Government agents?
AC_ANJ_L2_404
Not quite. I'm a shinobi, and he's a geisha.
AC_ANJ_L2_405
And though she's isn't here, we have a ronin, too.^n;Wait, who's the geisha?!
AC_ANJ_L2_406
Join us, and all we'll need is a shogun.
AC_ANJ_L2_407
Is this a bit?
AC_ANJ_L2_408
No more words, let's get this started!
AC_ANJ_L2_411
This isn't good. I have no idea what's happening...
AC_ANJ_L2_412
Is this...terror I feel?^n;I've almost forgotten what it felt like...
AC_ANJ_L2_413
...What exactly is it that you want?
AC_ANJ_L2_414
Oh, come now. Didn't you feel our intentions^n;coming through our fists?
AC_ANJ_L2_415
Let's be friends.
AC_ANJ_L2_416
...
AC_ANJ_L2_417
That's it?
AC_ANJ_L2_418
That's it.
AC_ANJ_L2_419
And spare us the "it ill suits me" nonsense.
AC_ANJ_L2_420
Because we're not taking no for an answer.
AC_ANJ_L2_421
In that case, sure.
AC_ANJ_L2_422
Yahoo!!!
AC_ANJ_L2_423
Daimyo!!!
AC_ANJ_L2_424
YEEAAAH!
AC_ANJ_L2_425
YEEAAAH!
AC_ANJ_L2_426
Yeeah...
AC_ANJ_L3_301
Through here. You ready?
AC_ANJ_L3_302
You've fought him before, right, Boss?^n;How was it?
AC_ANJ_L3_303
He's damn strong.
AC_ANJ_L3_304
...I see.
AC_ANJ_L3_305
...That's AWESOME!
AC_ANJ_L3_306
RIGHT?!
AC_ANJ_L3_307
Okay, let's get warmed up!
AC_ANJ_L3_308
Yeehaw!
AC_ANJ_L3_311
Come on, out of gas before the race starts?
AC_ANJ_L3_312
That's what I get for keeping the pedal to the floor...
AC_ANJ_L3_313
Don't worry about me, I'll catch up in no time.^n;You go on ahead.
AC_ANJ_L3_314
You're so cool, Boss.^n;Maybe too cool.
AC_ANJ_L3_315
Just don't complain if you miss all the fun.
AC_ANJ_L3_321
Guess we're both in pretty good shape.
AC_ANJ_L3_322
Yeah. Let's go, while we're still fired up!
AC_ANJ_L3_323
Okey-dokey!
AC_ANJ_L3_324
Now I'm really getting hyped!
vnag401demoy_0_anj
I recognize your face.
vanj400demoy_0_nag
And soon you'll know the name: Anji Mito.
AC_ANJ_L3_401
An aikido practitioner?
AC_ANJ_L3_402
Dance, actually. But mine's a special kind of dance.
vnag401demoz_0_anj
Then let's see how it fares against unbreakable steel.
vanj400demoz_0_nag
...Boss, this is insane.^n;"Strong" doesn't BEGIN to describe this guy!
AC_ANJ_L3_501
Your spirit comes not from murderous intent, nor a thirst for battle...
AC_ANJ_L3_502
What an unusual experience.
AC_ANJ_L3_503
Unusual is right.
AC_ANJ_L3_504
We never thought you'd bait us into a counterattack.
AC_ANJ_L3_505
And you still managed to keep your Four Temptations in check.
AC_ANJ_L3_506
Haha. I enjoyed our battle. Farewell.
AC_ANJ_L3_507
Yeah, until next time!
AC_ANJ_L3_508
...Er, wait, no!
vino400demoa_0
This'll be a fun gig.
vino400demob_0
I don't do encores. ♪
vino400democ_0
I want more than just foreplay.
vino401demoa_0
I'll play with you.
vino401demob_0
I can't hold myself back.
vino401democ_0
I like a good jam session.
vino402demoa_0
Play with me again.
vino402demob_0
That was a beautiful falsetto.
vino402democ_0
At least you made it to the bridge.
vino400demoa_0_sol
That sounds fun.
vino401demoa_0_sol
Can you die real quick?
vino402demoa_0_sol
Needs more treble.
vino402demob_0_sol
You haven't even adjusted the bias.
vino402democ_0_sol
There's more to life than a heavy bottom end.
vino400demoa_0_axl
Only if it's with someone else.
vino401demoa_0_axl
Aren't you eager to shorten your life...
vino402demoa_0_axl
If your resolve bends to pity, then it isn't real.
vino402demob_0_axl
What's wrong?^n;Can't ask me out lying on the ground now, can you?
vino402democ_0_axl
Just leave me alone.^n;I can't stand the sight of your hair.
vino401demoa_0_ino
Never much liked bootlegs.
vino400demoa_0_ino
Do you stack up against the official?
vino401demob_0_ino
I don't like singing in unison.
vino400demob_0_ino
Don't worry, only one of us will be screaming.
vino402demoa_0_ino
A cover will never top the original.
vino400demoa_0_cos
I'm also the reason for your destruction.
vino401demoa_0_cos
The future is mine to create.
vino402demoa_0_cos
Now, let existence begin.
vino401demov_0_ino
I-No. That's a lovely name.^n;I feel like I've heard it before.
vino400demov_0_ino
Is this me from the past...?^n;Another ghost of this paradox, I guess.
AC_INO_L1_101
Why did you hold back?
AC_INO_L1_102
You have no reason to keep me alive.
AC_INO_L1_103
Well, I actually do have a reason.
AC_INO_L1_104
I've never seen someone look so miserable.
AC_INO_L1_105
...Damn, was I always so sappy?
AC_INO_L1_111
I lost...^n;Haha. Guess I only get to be God for half a day.
AC_INO_L1_112
Are you God?
AC_INO_L1_113
Was. Past tense.
AC_INO_L1_201
Do gods have a lot of pride?
AC_INO_L1_202
Until they get their ass kicked by a human, they do.
AC_INO_L1_211
..Why did you save me?
AC_INO_L1_212
If you saw someone in trouble right in front of you,^n;wouldn't you do the same?
AC_INO_L1_213
...Is that the kind of shit I used to say?
vnag401demow_0_ino
In time, your existence will destroy the world.^n;I have to kill you, before it's too late.
vino400demow_0_nag
What a shitty paradox.
AC_INO_L1_401
Get lost, before you get caught up in all this.
AC_INO_L1_402
Who are you?
AC_INO_L1_403
At this point, I couldn't care less how many times I have to die.
AC_INO_L1_404
Well, God, I'm not about to tell you to treasure your life.^n;But I will warn you not to throw it away.
AC_INO_L1_405
Keep that up and you'll forget how to love.
AC_INO_L1_406
...
AC_INO_L1_407
...Haha.
AC_INO_L1_408
Twins in damnation...
AC_INO_L1_409
I've had a change of heart.
AC_INO_L1_411
This change... From where?
AC_INO_L1_412
Dunno. But I suddenly felt like flipping through an old album.
AC_INO_L1_413
It's just on a whim.
AC_INO_L1_414
Humans. You will not die today.
AC_INO_L1_421
Something, changed within you.
AC_INO_L1_422
Different spirit, fighting for humanity.
AC_INO_L1_423
Will let this pass.
AC_INO_L1_424
Fighting for humanity...? Me?
vnag401demox_0_ino
There are demons within you.
vino400demox_0_nag
Well, well... What kind of paradox do we have here?
AC_INO_L2_401
He's strong. And he's after you.
AC_INO_L2_402
And you.
AC_INO_L2_403
Run. I'll buy you some time.
AC_INO_L2_404
...
AC_INO_L2_405
The two of us should be able to take him down.
AC_INO_L2_411
I yield. Lacking reason.
AC_INO_L2_412
No need to cut you down.
AC_INO_L2_413
You saved me... Why?
AC_INO_L2_414
The most selfish bastard alive once told me...
AC_INO_L2_415
Before you try to change the world,
AC_INO_L2_416
find the parts of yourself that don't change.
AC_INO_L2_417
I don't know if I even have any of those...
AC_INO_L2_418
...But there were some things I wanted left unchanged.
AC_INO_L3_301
Are you me, from the future?
AC_INO_L3_302
Bingo.^n;Time sands down all that optimism, and you grow to resent everything.
AC_INO_L3_303
Am I'm gonna turn out like you?
AC_INO_L3_304
You really wanna know?
AC_INO_L3_311
You were trapped in a fictional world,^n;struggling to get out all the while.
AC_INO_L3_312
I thought that if I reconstructed the world,^n;something might change.
AC_INO_L3_313
But that wasn't really what you desired.
AC_INO_L3_314
What do you mean?
AC_INO_L3_315
If that truly was your dream, you would have told me to do it.
AC_INO_L3_316
...Shit.
AC_INO_L3_321
So you became a god to reconstruct the world?
AC_INO_L3_322
Once everything starts to look like fiction, you'll do the same.
AC_INO_L3_323
I doubt that.
AC_INO_L3_324
Because now you're here.^n;And I'm not alone.
AC_INO_L3_325
...
vnag401demoy_0_ino
Strike, strike, strike down the calamity.
vino400demoy_0_nag
*sigh* What a stupid world I'm trapped in.
AC_INO_L3_401
Strike, strike, strike, STRIKE!^n;Strike down the calamity!
AC_INO_L3_402
Ugh, guess the samurai's done playing around.
vnag401demoz_0_ino
Power maximum. Death assured.
vino400demoz_0_nag
It was a mere human that destroyed me^n;after I became a god.
AC_INO_L3_501
You can kill me. But let the other one go.
AC_INO_L3_502
A change within you. But for what?
AC_INO_L3_503
Look, I get it. This place is an after-image.^n;An echo of a world that doesn't exist.
AC_INO_L3_504
Even so...
AC_INO_L3_505
Your strength is...immense. Motherly.
AC_INO_L3_506
"Motherly"?
AC_INO_L3_507
You know... I never really thought about why we living things have children.
AC_INO_L3_508
Mother may live.
vgld400demoa_0
You fixin' to start a war there, hoss?
vgld400demob_0
What's that? You wanna know what's in this coffin?
vgld400democ_0
You'd do well to address me as "Sir."
vgld400demoa_3
Hmm... That's a strange pet ya got there.
vgld401demoa_0
You ain't winnin' this arms race.
vgld401demob_0
Come and give me all you got.
vgld401democ_0
Eliminatin' mission obstruction.
vgld401demoa_3
A fellow enthusiast! Let's show off our UMAs, shall we?
vgld600demoa_0
What is it? Huh? Anyone there?!
vgld600demob_0
Mr. President, hello! Hello? Wrong number...?
vgld600democ_0
Yes, hello? Pizza...? I didn't order any pizza...
vgld402demoa_0
How do they always run away so fast...?
vgld402demob_0
What in tarnation...?
vgld402democ_0
Hmm... Well, it's just about mealtime anyway.
vgld400demoa_0_fau
Subject File 2534. Speech-level intelligence confirmed.
vgld401demoa_0_fau
Classified UMA encountered. Preparing to capture.
vgld400demoa_0_gio
Stop foolin' around and fight.
vgld401demoa_0_gio
No holdin' back; no foolin' around.
vgld600demoa_0_chp
Erica? Yeah. Consider your boy scouted.
vgld402demoa_0_chp
Oh crap... Now what do I tell 'er?
vgld401demoa_0_gld
Always knew Doppelgangers existed.
vgld400demoa_0_gld
Says you. I'm addin' you to my collection.
vgld401demob_0_gld
That's a top-secret UMA. I'm takin' you in.
vgld400demob_0_gld
Huh... Not a bad impersonation for a UMA.
vgld600demoa_0_gld
Like I toldja, another me showed up and...
vgld402demoa_0_gld
Was I just dreamin'...?
vgld650demoa_0_chp
What is it? Huh? Anyone there?!
vgld650demoa_0
What is it? Huh? Anyone there?!
vgld650demob_0_chp
Yes, hello? Pizza...? I didn't order any pizza...
vgld650demob_0
Yes, hello? Pizza...? I didn't order any pizza...
vgld651demoa_0_chp
How do they always run away so fast...?
vgld651demoa_0
How do they always run away so fast...?
vgld651demob_0_chp
Hmm... Well, it's just about mealtime anyway.
vgld651demob_0
Hmm... Well, it's just about mealtime anyway.
vgio401demov_0_gld
Hey there, Boss. Out for a stroll?
vgld400demov_0_gio
What're you doin' here? Return to your post.
AC_GLD_L1_101
Who, me? I'm, uh... On a business trip, yeah. Boy, so busy.
AC_GLD_L1_102
Can the bullshit. I think I know exactly why you're here.
AC_GLD_L1_103
Stop chasin' the Nightless.
AC_GLD_L1_104
So you're gonna get in my way too, huh?
AC_GLD_L1_105
First one there gets him. Later.
AC_GLD_L1_111
Look, I do not have time for more of your training.
AC_GLD_L1_112
Enough. You're lookin' for that vampire. That ain't your mission.
AC_GLD_L1_113
Then you're after him too, Boss? Wow, if only I'd known...
AC_GLD_L1_114
Heel, Giovanna.
AC_GLD_L1_115
Sounds like we gotta interrogate Mr. Goldilocks.
AC_GLD_L1_201
What, you too hungry to fight?
AC_GLD_L1_202
Don't just stand there, lemme a hand!
AC_GLD_L1_211
I thought I told you to head home.
AC_GLD_L1_212
You literally hired me to tail people.
AC_GLD_L1_213
...Fine, do whatever you want.
AC_GLD_L1_214
You catch on quick. I like that.
vnag401demow_0_gld
So you've come to collect me? Don't waste your time.
vgld400demow_0_nag
I can offer you a place you'll be comfortable.
AC_GLD_L1_401
Hi. Ready to get bitch slapped?
AC_GLD_L1_402
So the hunt begins.
AC_GLD_L1_403
So be it. We can fill two graves today.
AC_GLD_L1_411
You've insufficiently trained your hunting dog.
AC_GLD_L1_412
Hear that, Boss? He's calling you a bad dog trainer. Ouch.
AC_GLD_L1_413
You're the one he's callin' a dog...
AC_GLD_L1_414
Enough of this. Find another member for your comedy troupe.
AC_GLD_L1_421
Why are you so determined to capture me?
AC_GLD_L1_422
Nothin' special. We just want a few more heavy hitters on our side.
AC_GLD_L1_423
I alone choose who I wield my blade for.
AC_GLD_L1_424
Nrgh... Stubborn samurai...
vnag401demox_0_gld
Return to your coffin-maker. That will not fit your corpse.
vgld400demox_0_nag
Lucky for you, vampire, it's just the right size for your bed.
AC_GLD_L2_401
Boss, are you seriously trying to tame this guy?
AC_GLD_L2_402
Sure. He'd be better-behaved than you are.
AC_GLD_L2_403
I refuse to become a dog of any government.
AC_GLD_L2_411
I will not say it twice: Leave.
AC_GLD_L2_412
Let's go home, Boss.
AC_GLD_L2_413
Fine by me. Our business here is done.
AC_GLD_L2_414
How curious. I thought you would be more persistent.
AC_GLD_L2_415
Well, we did what we came here to do.
AC_GLD_L2_416
If you ever wanna join us, you're welcome to. That's all we wanted you to know.
AC_GLD_L3_301
So, how goes the big vampire hunt?
AC_GLD_L3_302
Outside of the unruly huntin' dog, y'mean?
AC_GLD_L3_311
I'm pretty sure I get what you're after now.
AC_GLD_L3_312
Then will you leave me to it?
AC_GLD_L3_313
I'd rather handle it myself, but it looks like my business trip is over.
AC_GLD_L3_314
Give him a good kick in the ass for me, though.
AC_GLD_L3_321
What are you really after, Boss? Why even confront that thing?
AC_GLD_L3_322
He needs a friendly ear.
AC_GLD_L3_323
...
AC_GLD_L3_324
First he gets used and abused, and now people are chasin' him down like he's Bigfoot or somethin'.
AC_GLD_L3_325
If nothin' else, I wanna be there for him. Show him he's got a place in our world.
AC_GLD_L3_326
...
AC_GLD_L3_327
That too brazen for a government man?
AC_GLD_L3_328
Does this have something to do with whatever's in that coffin?
AC_GLD_L3_329
...
vnag401demoy_0_gld
What brings you to me?
vgld400demoy_0_nag
Scoutin'.
AC_GLD_L3_401
Power overwhelming power itself...
AC_GLD_L3_402
You willin' to hear us out now?
vnag401demoz_0_gld
Then I will fell you with more power still!
vgld400demoz_0_nag
Rgh... Just listen to reason, dammit!
AC_GLD_L3_501
Enough. Further fighting is pointless.
AC_GLD_L3_502
Yeah, you've proved your point. Forget capturin' ya.
AC_GLD_L3_503
Your heart ain't that of a vampire. Just a human.
AC_GLD_L3_504
And I don't collect humans.
AC_GLD_L3_505
Just a human, you say? Hahaha... You're one bold man, you know that?
vjko400demoa_0
I'm gonna GETCHA! ...uh...just kidding.
vjko400demob_0
Funny Halloween! ...Ahaha...ha.
vjko400democ_0
Your psyche is-- Ehehe... Okay, yeah, let's just start.
vjko401demoa_0
Trick or...treat...
vjko401demob_0
T-Trick or treat!
vjko401democ_0
Trick or... Oh, forget it.
vjko402demoa_0
Thank you, everyone! Whoa! What the--
vjko604demoa_0
Ahahaha! Thanks, guys!
vjko402demob_0
We couldn't have done it without you-- Eep!
vjko604demob_0
Hehe! We did it!
vjko402democ_0
Time to skedaddle on out of here-- Whoa!
vjko604democ_0
Whoa! Ahaha. Aw, shucks.
vjko400demoa_0_sol
Sure is. And you're an injured soldier.
vjko401demoa_0_sol
So you're gonna help me train?
vjko401demoa_0_jko
Trick or-- What, no candy?
vjko400demoa_0_jko
I think we're probably past that.
vjko401demob_0_jko
You know what I'm thinking?
vjko400demob_0_jko
You're the brain, right? I'm supposed to have fun!
vjko400demoa_0_ask
Yeah, but you're just as Asuka as any Asuka.
vjko400demoa_5_ask
Yep, you're the Asuka I know.
vjko400demoa_0_sin
Is that a Frederick impression? I don't think that's too smart...
vjko400demob_0_ask
A Battle Method Turing Test? That doesn't really sound like you.
vjko400democ_0_ask
Glad to see you, too. We both are.
vjko401demoa_0_ask
Wow, Asuka! You really outdo yourself!
vjko401demoa_5_ask
Incognito? It's okay, I won't tell Frederick.
vjko401demoa_0_sin
C'mon, tell me what's troubling you!
vjko401demob_0_ask
Trick or--Oh, it's you, Asuka.
vjko401democ_0_ask
Uh, you sure you got time for this?
vjko401demov_0_jko
What's up?
vjko400demov_0_jko
I need to know something.
AC_JKO_L1_101
You find what you were looking for?
AC_JKO_L1_102
I thought you would disappear once I became human.
AC_JKO_L1_103
But I was wrong. You're not a bug or another voice in my head.
AC_JKO_L1_104
Wow, that's rude. You're the one who called me, y'know.
AC_JKO_L1_105
Buuut, now that you've figured that out, why don't we get back to our original purpose?
AC_JKO_L1_111
Hmm...
AC_JKO_L1_112
What did you wanna know so badly?
AC_JKO_L1_113
A kung-fu girl once told me, "when in doubt, start throwing punches."
AC_JKO_L1_114
What are you to me?
AC_JKO_L1_115
Now I get it. I guess I'd say...
AC_JKO_L1_116
You should try punching a little harder!
AC_JKO_L1_201
Need any help?
AC_JKO_L1_202
Help? But how would you...?
AC_JKO_L1_211
How weird. When you're around, I can move just like I used to.
AC_JKO_L1_212
...A "thank you" would have been fine.
AC_JKO_L1_213
Anyway, you know I know, right? What you're really after.
AC_JKO_L1_214
What?
AC_JKO_L1_215
It might be too early to tell you, though. I'll give ya a little more time to figure it out.
vnag401demow_0_jko
What brings you to me?
vjko400demow_0_nag
That's what I want to know.
AC_JKO_L1_401
Want me to tell you why you're here?
AC_JKO_L1_402
Will I find out if we fight him together?
AC_JKO_L1_403
Now you're gettin' it!
AC_JKO_L1_404
Why challenge  me? I've nothing to do with you.
AC_JKO_L1_411
How odd. It feels as though I've gained something... But what?
AC_JKO_L1_412
Wow. Am I seriously the only adult here?
AC_JKO_L1_413
Wh-What are you talking about?
AC_JKO_L1_414
You're both so awkward.
AC_JKO_L1_415
See ya around, maybe!
AC_JKO_L1_416
Why am I so... full of doubt?
AC_JKO_L1_421
Enough of this. Though I may have time to spare, this is a waste of it.
AC_JKO_L1_422
You're right. I'm sorry.
AC_JKO_L1_423
But I can sense what it is that is bothering you.
AC_JKO_L1_424
You can?
AC_JKO_L1_425
Recognize what ails you before you return to me.
vnag401demox_0_jko
How bizarre. It's as if there are two of you.
vjko400demox_0_nag
Oh, phew. That makes this conversation easier.
AC_JKO_L2_401
So the two of you are one and the same.
AC_JKO_L2_402
I think we can help you.
AC_JKO_L2_403
As much as I hate to disappoint you, I'm afraid that would be impossible.
AC_JKO_L2_411
This place is so beautiful. A bit too spacious for one, though.
AC_JKO_L2_412
It is a samurai's duty to serve the one he believes in.
AC_JKO_L2_413
But my war is over, and I have no master to serve.
AC_JKO_L2_414
This world has no place for me.
AC_JKO_L2_415
I used to think the same. Even though I had lots of people telling me otherwise.
AC_JKO_L2_416
I was just lucky that I...
AC_JKO_L2_417
I realized I already had someone. Someone nearer to me than anyone else.
AC_JKO_L2_418
...Perhaps I have yet to find myself.
AC_JKO_L2_419
The Book of Five Rings.
AC_JKO_L2_420
I never imagined I would receive a lesson in sunyata from someone so young.
AC_JKO_L2_421
I give you my thanks. Let us meet again.
AC_JKO_L3_301
He's just ahead. Are you ready?
AC_JKO_L3_302
Thank you. For being so supportive, I mean.
AC_JKO_L3_303
I was so obsessed with fulfilling my purpose that I pushed you away.
AC_JKO_L3_304
Don't sweat it. You're stuck with me, through thick and thin!
AC_JKO_L3_311
I was able to repair the non-working sectors, but it's gonna be a while before I can merge the caches.
AC_JKO_L3_312
So for now, I'm gonna pass the decoding and execution privileges to you, okay?
AC_JKO_L3_313
Hehe. Maybe you're the adult here.
AC_JKO_L3_314
Nah, we're still both kids. But I'm the legs and you're the head.
AC_JKO_L3_315
In other words: instinct and reason.
AC_JKO_L3_316
Ooh, or how about the face and the mask? I think that fits us better.
AC_JKO_L3_317
Now, let's get this party started!
AC_JKO_L3_321
Hmm, looks like merging these partitions is going to take a bit longer.
AC_JKO_L3_322
Perspective changes everything.
AC_JKO_L3_323
It may be convenient for things to stay the way they are, at least for now.
AC_JKO_L3_324
Sure, that's fine by me. I'm cool with rolling with it.
AC_JKO_L3_325
Then shall we?
vnag401demoy_0_jko
You're not here to cut me down nor be cut down. Why have you come?
vjko400demoy_0_nag
To preach the diversity of our era.
AC_JKO_L3_401
I yield. I am no match for you.
AC_JKO_L3_402
Maybe that was uncalled for?
AC_JKO_L3_403
You've got it rough. So many people imposing their ideals upon you.
vnag401demoz_0_jko
Even if that were true, where could I possibly belong?
vjko400demoz_0_nag
I'll show you.
AC_JKO_L3_501
You... You exhaust me. Why do you not fear me?
AC_JKO_L3_502
I mean, I do? But I want more friends.
AC_JKO_L3_503
I am a samurai.
AC_JKO_L3_504
A relic of the past.
AC_JKO_L3_505
Which is a boring way of saying... you're new to this world.
AC_JKO_L3_506
Me too. This is all new to me.
AC_JKO_L3_507
We're two members of the same class.
AC_JKO_L3_508
Heh.
AC_JKO_L3_509
Many have visited this place.
AC_JKO_L3_510
Though I hate to echo the words of Chaos... these are interesting times indeed.
AC_JKO_L3_511
I must return to greet the ninja and the geisha for now.
AC_JKO_L3_512
But we shall meet again. Farewell.
vcos400demoa_0
Skip the explanation, and let's just have fun.
vcos400demob_0
My script has no room for accidents, got it?
vcos400democ_0
Okay, now this story has its opening line.
vcos401demoa_0
Show me your theme.
vcos401demob_0
Let's start the audition.
vcos401democ_0
Already read the synopsis.
vcos402demoa_0
*sigh* Just a regular old unhappy ending.
vcos402demob_0
No... You're not the reason I exist. Not yet, anyway.
vcos402democ_0
I feel like we'll meet again. Given who you are...
vcos400demoa_1
I'm happy to see you, too.
vcos400demob_1
I'm not always the enemy, mind you.
vcos400democ_1
I'm not really a direct combat guy.
vcos400demoa_0_sol
Whatever it is, it's still going up.
vcos401demoa_0_sol
Can you collect a bounty on someone who doesn't die?
vcos402demoa_0_sol
I'll be back. You're the star of the show, no matter what world I'm in.
vcos400demoa_0_nag
Aww. Y'know, I don't get that as often as you'd think.
vcos401demoa_0_nag
Can I offer you a hundred years of freedom?
vcos402demoa_0_nag
Hop in. We've got more trips to take.
vcos650demoa_0_anj
The extent? Oh, you don't know the half of it.
vcos651demoa_0_anj
So you're the one who's been looking into me all this time.
vcos402demoa_0_anj
You coming with? It feels like you wanna know more about me.
vcos400demoa_0_ino
Delusional, but ambitious.Great stuff.
vcos401demoa_0_ino
Are you the reason for my existence?
vcos402demoa_0_ino
I'll give you a future, but you'll end up in the past.
vcos401demob_0_cos
Can I play the antagonist?
vcos400demob_0_cos
Sure, then I'll be the protagonist.
vcos401demoa_0_cos
Wait, which one of us is real again?
vcos400demoa_0_cos
Beats me.
vcos402demoa_0_cos
Want a ride? Just think what we could get up to.
vcos400demoa_0_sin

vcos401demoa_0_sin

vcos400demoa_0_ask
You always know just what to say.
vcos400demoa_5_ask
Be honest--it's an experiment. ^n;Now, which one of us is the guinea pig?
vcos400demoa_0_bed
Ah, so that's your archetype.
vcos650demoa_0_bkn
Ugh, why'd it have to be you? Here I thought I was all done with fear.
vcos650demoa_0_sin
Oh, but the curtain goes up on time regardless.
vcos400demob_0_ask
Going all out, Asuka? I never thought I'd live to see it.
vcos400demob_5_ask
Boring. You know I have no interest in myself.
vcos400democ_0_ask
Two can play that game, but they don't make it through the Backyard.
vcos400democ_5_ask
Will? You mean like, from up on high? You know, it does pique my interest.
vcos401demoa_0_ask
...Back up. ^n;Asuka, Asuka, Asuka... You're a natural-born lunatic.
vcos401demoa_5_ask
Oh ho, did you just hijack my brain?
vcos401demoa_0_bed
Nice eyes. Interested in a role?
vcos651demoa_0_bkn
I've never seen an eye like that before.
vcos651demoa_0_sin
Care for some Milpico?
vcos401demob_0_ask
Battle Method Turing Tests? A psychophysical paradox.
vcos401demob_5_ask
I see it's the quiet one today.
vcos401democ_0_ask
Can I ask your name?
vcos401democ_5_ask
Wanna make your broadcasts a liiittle more interesting?
vcos402demoa_0_ask
Your moves, your thoughts--they're too rigid. ^n;You've got to leave room for interpretation.
vcos402demoa_5_ask
Not a single surprise in your work. What a bore.
vcos652demoa_0_bed
Rolling credits already? Really?
vcos652demoa_0_bkn
(Sigh) Win or lose, there's nothing in it for me. This is the worst.
vcos652demoa_0_sin
Come back when you're ready to push the plot forward, hero.
vino401demov_0_cos
An illusion?
vcos400demov_0_ino
Only one way to find out.
AC_COS_L1_101
For an illusion, you sure put up a good fight.
AC_COS_L1_102
Please. I'm no illusion. I'm a prisoner. Just like you, Boss.
AC_COS_L1_103
And this is one shitty prison. No action, and no drama.
AC_COS_L1_104
Oh, good. You're the real Chaos after all.
AC_COS_L1_105
How did you figure out I'd end up in this Paradox, anyway?
AC_COS_L1_106
After all we've been through, I can't imagine we'd be kept apart for too long.
AC_COS_L1_107
Let's take a walk.
AC_COS_L1_111
Well, you're real, all right. An illusion would've put up a better fight.
AC_COS_L1_112
Sorry, I was lost in my own head.
AC_COS_L1_113
Might as well stay in there. Beats this shitty Paradox.
AC_COS_L1_114
Nothing here ever bears fruit.
AC_COS_L1_115
You're right. And I'm sick of it.
AC_COS_L1_201
So, what, are you just gonna fight everyone that comes your way?
AC_COS_L1_202
Until I find the key, that's the plan?
AC_COS_L1_203
What key?
AC_COS_L1_204
Just help me out, will ya?
AC_COS_L1_210
You mentioned a "key." What is it?
AC_COS_L1_211
You don't know what a key is? It opens a locked door.
AC_COS_L1_212
And where does this door lead to? The world we came from?
AC_COS_L1_213
Heh. Ever wonder why keyholes exist?
AC_COS_L1_214
This place is a bookstore full of novels with ambiguous endings.
AC_COS_L1_215
And I don't like it one bit.
AC_COS_L1_216
Then this is where we part ways.
AC_COS_L1_217
...
AC_COS_L1_218
Look at that. She's figured out the nature of our existence here.
AC_COS_L1_219
See ya around.
AC_COS_L1_220
One day, someone's gonna need you.
vnag401demow_0_cos
Abomination! No ordinary human?
vcos400demow_0_nag
Oh, boy. You're definitely not the one.
AC_COS_L1_401
In this world, everybody comes out a little funny.
AC_COS_L1_402
Nothing "funny" about it. He's just one of a nearly infinite number of rejected outcomes.
AC_COS_L1_403
Youkai begone!
AC_COS_L1_411
A moment's withdrawal.
AC_COS_L1_412
You said he wasn't "the one." Who is?
AC_COS_L1_413
Hmm, how 'bout I give you a hint?
AC_COS_L1_414
You temporarily acquired the memories of the entire universe, right?
AC_COS_L1_415
So you SHOULD know where demi-humans came from. Do you?
AC_COS_L1_416
...!
AC_COS_L1_417
Son of a bitch... I can't remember anything about them.
AC_COS_L1_418
Aha, see? Now things are getting interesting.
AC_COS_L1_419
Come along. We've got some more adventuring to do.
AC_COS_L1_421
Piece of shit. I want nani-mo nothing to do with you.
AC_COS_L1_422
Aww, look, the fragment of possibility's aware enough to remember me.
AC_COS_L1_423
That's good. My hypothesis is starting to hold water.
AC_COS_L1_424
Let's hope I get to meet the real you next time.
vnag401demox_0_cos
Hatred: zero. Demo, I will cut you.
vcos400demox_0_nag
Now you're giving me high hopes.
AC_COS_L2_401
Looks like you're every bit as popular here.
AC_COS_L2_402
I'm pretty sure he's not the one, either. But I did gain something.
AC_COS_L2_403
He's sensing me.
AC_COS_L2_404
And what exactly did you "gain" on our not-so-ordinary walk?
AC_COS_L2_405
An entity similar to the real Nagoriyuki could be a key to our original world.
AC_COS_L2_406
Excuse me?
AC_COS_L2_407
So, what, you've started defining your own reason to exist?
AC_COS_L2_408
I've always had a mind of my own, but I've never had any purpose.
AC_COS_L2_409
But if I've got a way of escaping this place, doesn't that mean something has a purpose for me?
AC_COS_L2_410
Sounds like a question you should save for your therapist.
AC_COS_L2_411
So, what, you're saying that it's mere coincidence that you share an ID with a woman ^n;that isn't a parallel world version of you, but ALSO isn't a completely different person?
AC_COS_L2_412
...
AC_COS_L2_413
It must have been fate. The word you hate the most.
AC_COS_L2_414
I prefer to believe that I have a right to make my own choices.
AC_COS_L2_415
Besides, I hear the voices in my head calling out, "Save us!"
AC_COS_L2_416
Save us?
AC_COS_L2_417
Maybe next time, I'll be playing the hero.
AC_COS_L2_418
You dare avert your filthy gaze?!
AC_COS_L2_421
Munennn!
AC_COS_L2_422
So, what do you plan to do back in our original world?
AC_COS_L2_423
I already told you. Something's got a purpose for me. I'm sure it'll find me in time.
AC_COS_L2_424
But until it does, I guess I'm just gonna hang out and enjoy some good food.
AC_COS_L2_425
So, how 'bout it, Boss? You coming along?
AC_COS_L2_426
Well, that's a bold ask.
AC_COS_L2_427
I'm pretty sure you realize that if I go back now, I'll make a paradox of the whole damn timeline.
AC_COS_L2_428
Worried you're gonna tear the fabric of time?
AC_COS_L2_429
It may have more give than we think, Boss...
AC_COS_L2_430
...
AC_COS_L2_431
I'm not your boss anymore.
AC_COS_L2_432
Yeah... I guess not.
AC_COS_L2_433
I just hope I'll see you again.
AC_COS_L2_434
Buh bye.
AC_COS_L3_301
Hold it. You're hiding something from me.
AC_COS_L3_302
You got me. Yes, fine, I DO have a birthmark on my butt!
AC_COS_L3_303
There's a lot I haven't told you. You'll have to be more specific.
AC_COS_L3_304
All right. Then do you know a way out of this place?
AC_COS_L3_305
If I did, would you come with me?
AC_COS_L3_306
Answer the question: Do you know, or not?
AC_COS_L3_311
Okay, let's simmer down a little.
AC_COS_L3_312
No need to get spicy.
AC_COS_L3_313
You know what demi-humans are, right? Vampires, werewolves, that sorta thing?
AC_COS_L3_314
Well, if you thought Gears were neat, get a load of this.
AC_COS_L3_315
Demi-humans transcend genetics, physics, and even time itself.
AC_COS_L3_316
Put plainly, their very existence is essentially a bug in our world's programming.
AC_COS_L3_317
Unlike you or me, they don't have IDs. They're the same existences across Independent Segments.
AC_COS_L3_318
And because of that, they subconsciously contain information about parallel universes.
AC_COS_L3_319
Meaning that demi-humans can act as terminals that allow us access to parallel worlds.
AC_COS_L3_320
Though obviously, as dwellers of infinite timelines, they need to downconvert ^n;to our simple definition of Planck time in order to exist in what we call "the real world."
AC_COS_L3_321
And heavens to Betsy does that make finding actionable information on them difficult.^n;Like finding one particle of sand across the vastness of the universe.
AC_COS_L3_322
Did you know there was a guy named Bedman who managed to delete his own ID ^n;and became a multi-dimensional being?
AC_COS_L3_323
Anyway, that's where Nagoriyuki comes in. He wasn't born a demi-human. ^n;He became one. A hybrid, if you will.
AC_COS_L3_324
I can access different timelines by following little references in his old memories. ^n;Once I do that, the rest is simple.
AC_COS_L3_325
Oh, good. I was worried this might be complicated.
AC_COS_L3_326
Er... Yeah...
AC_COS_L3_327
Sorry, let's get back out of the weeds here.
AC_COS_L3_328
Are you coming with me, or not?
AC_COS_L3_329
...
AC_COS_L3_330
In a way, this paradox is the world I desired.
AC_COS_L3_331
There's no reason for me to leave it yet.
AC_COS_L3_332
To be clear:
AC_COS_L3_333
Your story was a fabrication,
AC_COS_L3_334
but I don't intend to rewrite it.
AC_COS_L3_335
Though I suspect that in the near future, someone will need you.
AC_COS_L3_336
And when that time comes...
AC_COS_L3_337
Come play with me again.
AC_COS_L3_341
Let's shake the serious talk for now.
AC_COS_L3_342
The answer you're looking for is just ahead.
vnag401demoy_0_cos
I... will. kill. you.
vcos400demoy_0_nag
Bullseye!
AC_COS_L3_401
My all... rests upon my blade...!
AC_COS_L3_402
I still can't believe I didn't get to see you go all out against Sol.
vnag401demoz_0_cos
You. Will. Not. Leave. This. PLACE!
vcos400demoz_0_nag
Sorry, but that's not up to me.
AC_COS_L3_501
Why... have you... been chosen...?
AC_COS_L3_502
I've got equal parts hope and resentment circulating through my body.
AC_COS_L3_503
If humanity doesn't learn to coexist, their survival instincts will swallow them whole. ^n;And until one or the other comes...
AC_COS_L3_504
I'm not going away.
AC_COS_L3_505
Maybe we'll find a possible past next time...
vbkn400demoa_0
You'll learn what your own words really mean.
vbkn400demob_0
At least try to buy your own bluff.
vbkn400democ_0
Better not hold back...
vbkn400demoa_0_nag
Try learning by doing!
vbkn400demoa_0_anj
Sure. Assuming you want to live.
vbkn650demoa_0_cos
That's 'cause I've never seen one like you before.
vbkn400demoa_0_sin
Yeah, sure.
vbkn401demoa_0_bkn
I like your eye.
vbkn400demoa_0_bkn
Yeah, I like it, too.
vbkn401demob_0_bkn
Beat it. Already got a mirror.
vbkn400demob_0_bkn
Take a look. I'll show you our good side.
vbkn401demoa_0
I'm shapeless. Ready to be cut free?
vbkn401demob_0
There's no winning or losing. Just knowing yourself.
vbkn401democ_0
My blade is your blade. Your blade is my blade.
vbkn401demoa_0_nag
First, taste defeat. Then we begin.
vbkn401demoa_0_anj
If you wanna dance... I'll take the lead.
vbkn651demoa_0_cos
I've gotta admit... I didn't think I'd be this calm.
vbkn400demoa_0_sin
Yeah, sure.
vbkn401demoa_0_sin
Didja learn anything?
vbkn401demoa_0_bed
What're you doin'? Done cleanin' already?
vbkn401demob_0_bed
That's one helluva mattress.
vbkn401democ_0_bed
Help me knock the rust off, will ya?
vbkn400demoa_0_bed
Nothin' I ain't seen before. C'mon.
vbkn400demob_0_bed
Don't gimme that look. Use your damn words.
vbkn400democ_0_bed
You said it, kid.
vanj401demov_0_bkn
Let's kick things off with a duel.
vbkn400demov_0_anj
With you? Why?
AC_BKN_L1_101
You gonna tell me why you're wasting my energy?
AC_BKN_L1_102
It's a ritual. It wouldn't be right to face the samurai with anything less than your entire spirit.
AC_BKN_L1_103
The hell do you think I came here for?
AC_BKN_L1_104
You're just itching to test out your new sword. After all these years, you think I can't read you? 
AC_BKN_L1_105
Tch. Shut up and let's go.
AC_BKN_L1_111
Whoa, now. What's with the soulless swings?
AC_BKN_L1_112
If that felt soulless, it just means you're spineless.
AC_BKN_L1_113
This new blade isn't for fighting. You know that.
AC_BKN_L1_114
Yes, I know, but I promised him a spirited ronin.
AC_BKN_L1_115
So, you know, show a little spirit!
AC_BKN_L1_201
The Baiken I know cut down anything that moved. What happened to you?
AC_BKN_L1_202
 Is that how you described me to her?
AC_BKN_L1_211
Now I'm starting to worry about you.
AC_BKN_L1_212
The flash of this blade can swallow a life whole.
AC_BKN_L1_213
Back when all I cared about was revenge, it was all so easy.
AC_BKN_L1_214
...I'm in your way, aren't I? Funny, I've never felt that before.
AC_BKN_L1_215
Fine. He's a straight shot from here. I'll just be watching from afar.
vnag401demow_0_bkn
...A samurai? Who do you serve?
vbkn400demow_0_nag
I'm not that big a deal.
AC_BKN_L1_401
I brought the ronin, just like I promised!
AC_BKN_L1_402
So I see. But have we any reason for the customary duel?
AC_BKN_L1_403
I don't... but it seems you sure as hell do.
AC_BKN_L1_404
Indeed... I will know what burns within your heart!
AC_BKN_L1_411
Impossible. You're a weak point diviner, too?
AC_BKN_L1_412
I'm more of a weak point divider.
AC_BKN_L1_413
Anji. I'm sorry to say, I am not prepared to fight her.
AC_BKN_L1_414
But when that time comes, I shall request a duel.
AC_BKN_L1_415
Well done, Nagoriyuki... You've figured out her true nature.
AC_BKN_L1_416
Hmph. You really think he'll stand by that?
AC_BKN_L1_417
He will. And you know it.
AC_BKN_L1_418
Self-reflection is practically his hobby.
AC_BKN_L1_419
Shit. This new sword of mine is already getting me in trouble.
AC_BKN_L1_420
But it beats the old trouble, right?
AC_BKN_L1_421
I have not yet asked for your name.
AC_BKN_L1_422
Baiken.
AC_BKN_L1_423
This is a first.
AC_BKN_L1_424
I don't know why, but my instincts themselves fear you.
AC_BKN_L1_425
Your instincts? You're not afraid of me. You're afraid of yourself.
AC_BKN_L1_426
Then you are my wall. And I will overcome you.
AC_BKN_L1_427
...Until then!
AC_BKN_L1_428
Figures that big body would have some huge guts.
AC_BKN_L1_429
See you again.
vnag401demox_0_bkn
So you must be Anji's ronin.
vbkn400demox_0_nag
And you must be a pain in the ass.
AC_BKN_L2_401
There isn't anything special about her...and yet...
AC_BKN_L2_402
Something isn't right.
AC_BKN_L2_403
Just as I thought. You can smell the difference.
AC_BKN_L2_404
Well, this doesn't look good. He's on the defensive.
AC_BKN_L2_405
Look alive. This is gonna take some willpower.
AC_BKN_L2_411
I have seen blades without bloodthirst.
AC_BKN_L2_412
Blades forged in joy, blades that offer compassion, and blades that inspire.
AC_BKN_L2_413
But yours is different.
AC_BKN_L2_414
I don't even know what it is myself.
AC_BKN_L2_415
But it does have a name.
AC_BKN_L2_416
Regret.
AC_BKN_L2_417
Sounds so lame...
AC_BKN_L2_418
Your regret is the strongest sword I've ever known..
AC_BKN_L2_419
Who is your teacher?
AC_BKN_L2_420
A kid. 'bout half my age
AC_BKN_L2_421
Hah. No wonder I can't win.
AC_BKN_L2_422
I hope to receive another lesson from you one day.
AC_BKN_L2_423
Wasn't that great?
AC_BKN_L2_424
Well, it wasn't bad, I'll give you that much.
AC_BKN_L2_425
This...is my new path forward.
AC_BKN_L3_301
Before we wrap up here... Let me see it.
AC_BKN_L3_302
You wouldn't understand it even if I did.
AC_BKN_L3_311
Is it just me? Or are you way less scary than usual?
AC_BKN_L3_312
This sword isn't for cutting people down. It's for cutting them free.
AC_BKN_L3_313
And you're enough of a free spirit already. It wouldn't do a thing to you
AC_BKN_L3_314
Oh, like you're perfect.
AC_BKN_L3_315
Damn straight. But one day I just started seeing it.
AC_BKN_L3_316
Right when I started living with "that girl", that is.
AC_BKN_L3_317
This isn't some sickness
AC_BKN_L3_318
It's probably enlightenment.
AC_BKN_L3_319
Then take whatever you see...
AC_BKN_L3_320
And show it to Nagoriyuki.
AC_BKN_L3_321
Er, hold on, sis, what did you just do?
AC_BKN_L3_322
That's not me. It's you.
AC_BKN_L3_323
What did you see? What did you feel?
AC_BKN_L3_324
Uh, well, I guess it was kinda fun?
AC_BKN_L3_325
You really are dense... But that's just who you are.
AC_BKN_L3_326
Not everyone has the same experience.
AC_BKN_L3_327
They see things they don't wanna see, and learn things they sure as hell don't wanna learn.
AC_BKN_L3_328
It's a far cry from a typical "peaceful sword" style...
AC_BKN_L3_329
But by overcoming the adversity before them, they can affirm themselves.
AC_BKN_L3_330
Allowing them to realize who they're really fighting.
AC_BKN_L3_331
In short, your sword is unbeatable.
AC_BKN_L3_332
You've got to let me see this through to the end.
vnag401demoy_0_bkn
Your eyes... You've awakened.
vbkn400demoy_0_nag
You don't even know what that means.
AC_BKN_L3_401
Who...are you?
AC_BKN_L3_402
The one who will cut you free.
vnag401demoz_0_bkn
Now nothing will weigh down my blade.
vbkn400demoz_0_nag
Try saying that like you mean it.
AC_BKN_L3_501
There are no flaws in my technique...
AC_BKN_L3_502
Yet my every strike feels as though I'm cutting myself down.
AC_BKN_L3_503
Defeating you is still beyond me.
AC_BKN_L3_504
I could've told you that. So lighten up already.
AC_BKN_L3_505
That's the shortest path to awakening.
AC_BKN_L3_506
Will we meet again?
AC_BKN_L3_507
My door's always open.
AC_BKN_L3_508
...I am glad to have met you.
AC_BKN_L3_509
Likewise. So long.
vtst400demoa_0
Let's see where your beauty lies.
vtst400demob_0
I don't recall any business with you.
vtst400democ_0
Fine, then. You have until my tea is ready.
vtst401demoa_0
Sink softly into slumber.
vtst401demob_0
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
vtst401democ_0
Well then. To a dazzling encounter.
vtst401demoa_0_tst
Oh? It looks like I've become quite the trendsetter.
vtst400demoa_0_tst
I was about to say the same thing.
vtst401demob_0_tst
You there, arms up a bit. It's more graceful.
vtst400demob_0_tst
Is that so? I was just thinking lower would be better.
vtst401demoa_0_kyk
Tell me, is Dizzy well?
vtst400demoa_0_kyk
Abandoning humanity for love? What a foolish king you are!
vtst401demoa_0_may
You've matured a bit.
vtst400demoa_0_may
It's so lovely to be back.
vtst602demoa_0
Always an utmost pleasure.
vtst401demoa_0_sin
There's a reward in it for you, if you win.
vtst400demoa_0_sin
Hm. You've got much to learn.
vtst402demoa_0
I have earned a bubble bath today.
vtst402demob_0
I'd say it's time for a tea break. Milk and sugar for you?
vtst402democ_0
Do try to learn your limits.
vtst650demoa_0_kyk
Abandoning humanity for love? What a foolish king you are!
vtst650demob_0_kyk
Abandoning humanity for love? What a foolish king you are!
vtst650democ_0_kyk
Abandoning humanity for love? What a foolish king you are!
vtst651demoa_0_kyk
Tell me, is Dizzy well?
vtst651demob_0_kyk
Tell me, is Dizzy well?
vtst651democ_0_kyk
Tell me, is Dizzy well?
vchp401demov_0_tst
What're you, some kinda Gear?
vtst400demov_0_chp
Indeed. Well, half Gear, anyway.
AC_TST_L1_101
You're not here to fight, are you?
AC_TST_L1_102
I wish you'd noticed a bit more quickly.
AC_TST_L1_103
You have any idea what's up ahead?
AC_TST_L1_104
Hmm... I can't say that I don't.
AC_TST_L1_105
Enough with the riddles. What're you here for?
AC_TST_L1_106
A stroll.
AC_TST_L1_107
Huh?
AC_TST_L1_108
A stroll, I said. Is that not a worthy enough reason for you?
AC_TST_L1_111
Well, at least you're not hostile.
AC_TST_L1_112
What's your game, here?
AC_TST_L1_113
How rude. Do you ask that of everyone you pass by?
AC_TST_L1_114
Course not!
AC_TST_L1_115
But let's say Musashi Miyamoto was right around the corner. That's different, right?
AC_TST_L1_116
I'd say not.
AC_TST_L1_117
I don't know any Miyamoto. Even if Gandhi were here, it's no business of mine.
AC_TST_L1_118
H-Hey!
AC_TST_L1_201
You're packin' too much power for a walk.
AC_TST_L1_202
Yet here I am.
AC_TST_L1_203
Do you take me for some sort of fiend?
AC_TST_L1_204
N-No, but... I mean...
AC_TST_L1_211
Why's someone as strong as you actin' like a normie?
AC_TST_L1_212
That's enough. Stop trying to goad me into a street fight.
AC_TST_L1_213
All I want is a cup of tea just ahead.
AC_TST_L1_214
Why? You can drink tea anywhere...
AC_TST_L1_215
My business is my own.
AC_TST_L1_216
Must I divulge it to a perfect stranger?
AC_TST_L1_217
...Huh. Good point.
AC_TST_L1_218
If that's how you feel, I'm gonna bounce. It's your funeral.
vnag401demow_0_tst
Who goes there?
vtst400demow_0_nag
No one worth naming.
AC_TST_L1_401
Tell me, No One: why are you here?
AC_TST_L1_402
Now, now. No need for aggression.
AC_TST_L1_403
I'm not here to pick a fight.
AC_TST_L1_404
Just what is going on here?
AC_TST_L1_405
Bombarding people with personal questions... Is this border security?
AC_TST_L1_406
Chipp. Explain.
AC_TST_L1_407
Can't. I just met 'em myself.
AC_TST_L1_408
Still, even you must know what he's capable of.
AC_TST_L1_409
He thinks he can simply pass through here?
AC_TST_L1_411
You threw the bout, didn't you?
AC_TST_L1_412
Th-That's right.
AC_TST_L1_413
Because I saw you had no intention to fight.
AC_TST_L1_414
I believe I said as much before.
AC_TST_L1_415
...My apologies.
AC_TST_L1_416
You've ruined my sightseeing. I'll be going now.
AC_TST_L1_417
What's with them...?
AC_TST_L1_421
If I may offer some unsolicited advice...
AC_TST_L1_422
Pick your battles a little more judiciously.
AC_TST_L1_423
Then... why did you come here?
AC_TST_L1_424
Do you own this land?
AC_TST_L1_425
Not... exactly.
AC_TST_L1_426
Have I pried into your affairs?
AC_TST_L1_427
All right. You've made your point. Sorry.
AC_TST_L1_428
Thank you. I'll try to enjoy this vista a little longer, then.
AC_TST_L1_429
I'm spoiling your view, then?
AC_TST_L1_430
Either way, I don't own this land, either.
AC_TST_L1_431
...How awkward.
vnag401demox_0_tst
What is it you want?
vtst400demox_0_nag
Nothing.
AC_TST_L2_401
Chipp... A friend of yours?
AC_TST_L2_402
Uh, nah, not really.
AC_TST_L2_403
Apparently they're just here for a stroll...
AC_TST_L2_404
To be precise, I'm here to enjoy the scenery over a cup of tea.
AC_TST_L2_405
Do you know who you're dealing with?
AC_TST_L2_406
Sure. The famous samurai.
AC_TST_L2_407
I hoped I might catch a glimpse of you.
AC_TST_L2_408
I am no tourist attraction.
AC_TST_L2_409
Cool it, Nagoriyuki!
AC_TST_L2_411
...Tell me truly. You have no other business with me?
AC_TST_L2_412
Like I said, a glimpse is all I'd hoped for.
AC_TST_L2_413
Doesn't smell like bullshit to me.
AC_TST_L2_414
Still, I can tell...
AC_TST_L2_415
There is great darkness in his heart.
AC_TST_L2_416
Hard to believe such a soul is here for mere human indulgence.
AC_TST_L2_417
Mere?
AC_TST_L2_418
What kind of indulgence could be sweeter?
AC_TST_L2_419
Here I thought you would understand...
AC_TST_L2_420
What happened to you?
AC_TST_L2_421
People did.
AC_TST_L2_422
I've been very lucky to meet people who've accepted me.
AC_TST_L2_423
I, too, used to carry myself like some sort of demon.
AC_TST_L2_424
Even though I was surrounded by accepting people.
AC_TST_L2_425
And that's who you claim to be?
AC_TST_L2_426
I'm not here to fix you. I'm just passing through.
AC_TST_L2_427
Though I did bring a bit too much tea for one person.
AC_TST_L2_428
If you'd like, I'll gladly share.
AC_TST_L2_429
A-All right, that's all I can take.
AC_TST_L3_301
Just tell us why you're here, already!
AC_TST_L3_302
Settle down, "officer."
AC_TST_L3_303
Just so you know, incessant questions often hide a guilty conscience.
AC_TST_L3_304
Maybe Mr. Sword should do the asking.
AC_TST_L3_311
(Sigh) Fine. At least you don't seem like you're lying.
AC_TST_L3_312
So you're really thoughtlessly wandering around here?
AC_TST_L3_313
Oh, there are thoughts.
AC_TST_L3_314
About my future, my family, tonight's dinner...
AC_TST_L3_315
About my job in construction, and whether it'd give me the time to moonlight as a fashion model...
AC_TST_L3_316
That's so normal!
AC_TST_L3_317
I AM normal!
AC_TST_L3_318
What, does a life need to have some grand purpose to be worth living?!
AC_TST_L3_319
No, no, you're totally right!
AC_TST_L3_320
But... But...
AC_TST_L3_321
You're just so strong!
AC_TST_L3_322
(sigh)
AC_TST_L3_323
That is why I'm here.
AC_TST_L3_324
It's dangerous, but pretty, and quiet.
AC_TST_L3_325
I've heard that those with grand purpose—and grander troubles—get trapped here.
AC_TST_L3_326
A little normality might be just the prescription.
AC_TST_L3_327
I don't intend to start anything. I'm just one person passing through. Is that really so odd?
AC_TST_L3_328
To me, this place you so desperately guard is a mere walking trail.
AC_TST_L3_329
...That so?
AC_TST_L3_330
This is all over my head, but I get one thing.
AC_TST_L3_331
It is a pretty slick spot, when you look at it.
AC_TST_L3_332
And you might be the slickest thing here.
AC_TST_L3_333
See? You can play well with others if you try. Thank you.
AC_TST_L3_334
Sorry I bothered ya.
AC_TST_L3_341
Mrrrgh...
AC_TST_L3_342
NOW I get it! You're an IDIOT!
AC_TST_L3_343
You take that back, now.
AC_TST_L3_344
Besides, look who's talking!
AC_TST_L3_345
I mean, you KNOW this place is dangerous.
AC_TST_L3_346
And you're here for a stroll?!
AC_TST_L3_347
Try picking up on the vibes for once, will ya?!
AC_TST_L3_348
Once again, look who's talking!
AC_TST_L3_349
If anything's dangerous here, it's you!
AC_TST_L3_350
But no matter.
AC_TST_L3_351
If it'll shut you up, yes, I'm an idiot.
AC_TST_L3_352
Hold up. Sorry. You didn't deserve that.
vnag401demoy_0_tst
You're either inhuman, or uncommonly skilled.
vtst400demoy_0_nag
Is it that uncommon? Look at yourself.
AC_TST_L3_401
Oh dear, I don't want my clothes getting any dirtier...
AC_TST_L3_402
I'll leave them here. I don't suppose you'd lend me some of yours?
AC_TST_L3_403
So you're the talkative type. I've seen that before.
AC_TST_L3_404
I take it that small talk's not your forte.
AC_TST_L3_405
Why are you breathing so heavily?
AC_TST_L3_406
To show you the danger you're in!
vnag401demoz_0_tst
Go on! Keep prattling, see what happens!
vtst400demoz_0_nag
Oh, may I?
AC_TST_L3_501
Because once there was a boy who dreamed of building a rocket.^n;He gathered scraps together, but something was missing.^n;He asked his parents what it was, and they have him a math textbook.
AC_TST_L3_502
Then one day, the boy had his rocket at last.^n;His parents asked him where he wanted to go.^n;The boy replied, "a planet without math!"
AC_TST_L3_503
Stop! Stop!!
AC_TST_L3_504
Ugh... Fine. I yield. Victory is yours.
AC_TST_L3_505
I have no need for victory.
AC_TST_L3_506
Then I yield my understanding.
AC_TST_L3_507
Is that right? Then please tell me your name.
AC_TST_L3_508
You really don't know?
AC_TST_L3_509
Hmm. That's an odd name, but a memorable one.
AC_TST_L3_510
I'd say it suits you, Mr. Don't Know.
AC_TST_L3_511
Heh...
AC_TST_L3_512
Mr. Don't Know is my father. Please, call me You Really.
AC_TST_L3_513
Ha! By the way, would you like some tea?
AC_TST_L3_514
I would indeed.
vbgt400demoa_0
Whoever you are, welcome to the show!
vbgt400demob_0
Be sure and pay up if I win, okay?
vbgt400democ_0
Would you like some extra bloodshed to go with your beating?
vbgt401demoa_0
My show's not cheap, but it's worth it!
vbgt401demob_0
Get ready to applaud!
vbgt401democ_0
Allow me to transfix you! Hee hee hee...
vbgt401democ_1
I'm not the Bridget you once knew!
vbgt651demoa_0_sol
You're a bounty hunter, too! Let's be friends!
vbgt650demoa_0_sol
But I was just there the other day!
vbgt401demoa_0_may
Don't you think we'd make a good tag team?
vbgt401demoa_0_bgt
Ohh, you're cute! ...But I'm way cuter!
vbgt400demoa_0_bgt
We'd better settle this with a cute-off!
vbgt401demob_0_bgt
There's another Roger...?
vbgt400demob_0_bgt
Ohh, this is bad! Double the Roger, double the danger!
vbgt402demoa_0
Sorry, no installment plan! Pay up, please!
vbgt402demob_0
No photos, please! How about an autograph?
vbgt402democ_0
Keep your eyes on me next time!
vbgt402demoa_1
Don't hate me because I'm adorable!
vbgt402democ_1
Well? How do you like the new Bridget?
vbgt402demoa_0_may
Teeheehee, looks aren't everything!
vbgt402demoa_0_bgt
Did you... learn anything?
vgld401demov_3_bgt
You're hidin' an UMA, ain't you?
vbgt400demov_0_gld
You're not taking Roger away from me!
AC_BGT_L1_101
No wonder you're so famous. Looks are deceivin'.
AC_BGT_L1_102
I'll be back for more later, li'l lady.
AC_BGT_L1_103
I'm... I'm a boy.
AC_BGT_L1_104
These girl-clothes are... It's a long story.
AC_BGT_L1_105
...I see.
AC_BGT_L1_111
Well? Ready to give up yet?
AC_BGT_L1_112
Hmm. That's all for today. You're a tough cookie.
AC_BGT_L1_113
You see any other UMAs, you let me know, li'l lady.
AC_BGT_L1_114
I'm... a boy.
AC_BGT_L1_115
...That right? Sorry 'bout that, hoss.
AC_BGT_L1_201
That was hard to watch.
AC_BGT_L1_202
I-I haven't even gotten started!
AC_BGT_L1_211
Thank you very much! It's all thanks to you!
AC_BGT_L1_212
I've got to toughen up! Y'know, since I'm a boy and all... Heh heh...
AC_BGT_L1_213
You really mean that?
AC_BGT_L1_214
It sure ain't what your eyes are sayin'.
AC_BGT_L1_215
...
vkyk401demow_0_bgt
Good to see you. You haven't changed a bit.
vbgt400demow_0_kyk
Yes, long time no see! ...Did you cut your hair?
AC_BGT_L1_401
Come on, let me show you how far I've come!
AC_BGT_L1_402
I suppose a quick spar wouldn't hurt...
AC_BGT_L1_403
C'mon, kid, I can't watch you hurt yourself.
AC_BGT_L1_405
I-I'm not a "kid," okay?!
AC_BGT_L1_411
It's true you've grown stronger, yes... But also more hesitant.
AC_BGT_L1_412
Is something troubling you?
AC_BGT_L1_413
T-Troubling me? No... Well, not exactly...
AC_BGT_L1_414
I'm happy... But I don't know if I'm REALLY happy.
AC_BGT_L1_415
Happiness is difficult to define. However...
AC_BGT_L1_416
If you have doubts, then perhaps it's time you take a new step.
AC_BGT_L1_417
A new step...?
AC_BGT_L1_418
Never hurts to get a good look at yourself from another angle.
AC_BGT_L1_419
I'll... I'll think about it. About my happiness... and my future.
AC_BGT_L1_420
...Thank you so much! Both of you!
AC_BGT_L1_421
I sense great hesitance. Are you... distressed, perhaps?
AC_BGT_L1_422
Distressed? It's more like I'm... conflicted.
AC_BGT_L1_423
I just don't know if I should keep living like this.
AC_BGT_L1_424
So you're afraid, then. Of change.
AC_BGT_L1_425
...!
AC_BGT_L1_426
You're conflicted because you still cherish the present.
AC_BGT_L1_427
Perhaps you should consider what is truly important to you.
AC_BGT_L1_428
...You may be right.
AC_BGT_L1_429
Thank you so much, Mr. Ky!
vkyk401demox_0_bgt
I'm not who you remember me to be.
vbgt400demox_0_kyk
I challenge you to a duel, Mr. King!
AC_BGT_L2_401
I'm not the Bridget I used to be, either!
AC_BGT_L2_402
I made myself a top-class bounty hunter... And made loads of money in the process...
AC_BGT_L2_403
You don't look as confident as you sound.
AC_BGT_L2_404
...
AC_BGT_L2_405
Here I come. Show me how you've changed.
AC_BGT_L2_411
Stop right there. That's enough.
AC_BGT_L2_412
I... I don't know what to do.
AC_BGT_L2_413
I'm not strong like you, Mr. Ky. I'm too scared of losing what I have.
AC_BGT_L2_414
Runnin' away, huh? Ain't you a little young for a midlife crisis?
AC_BGT_L2_415
O-Of course I'm running! I'm happy the way I am...
AC_BGT_L2_416
Discretion can be the better part of valor...
AC_BGT_L2_417
But think about it. For the sake of your future self.
AC_BGT_L2_418
For my... Future self...
AC_BGT_L2_419
...But what if I make the wrong decision?
AC_BGT_L2_420
You got your whole life ahead of you, kid. Gotta learn to take a hit sometime.
AC_BGT_L2_421
And there are helping hands right in front of you.
AC_BGT_L2_422
...
AC_BGT_L2_423
I... I don't want to run scared anymore.
AC_BGT_L2_424
If I keep on faking it like this, I know I'll regret it...
AC_BGT_L2_425
So from now on, no matter what... No more lying to myself.
AC_BGT_L2_426
Thank you! Both of you!
AC_BGT_L2_427
Don't mention it. Happy trails, cowgirl. Or, uh, cowboy...?
AC_BGT_L2_428
Cowgirl is fine!
AC_BGT_L2_429
Because... I'm a girl!
AC_BGT_L3_301
I'm strict across the board. Don't take it personal.
AC_BGT_L3_302
It feels like you're EXTRA hard on me...
AC_BGT_L3_311
I mean, I... I...
AC_BGT_L3_312
...Know you're runnin’ away?
AC_BGT_L3_313
...!
AC_BGT_L3_315
How can you tell?
AC_BGT_L3_316
Cause I'm the same way.
AC_BGT_L3_317
I know what it's like to turn your back on yourself for too long.
AC_BGT_L3_318
I'm still tellin' myself it ain't my fault as we speak.
AC_BGT_L3_319
D'you know how long it's been since I saw my family?
AC_BGT_L3_320
...Do you regret it? Turning your back, I mean.
AC_BGT_L3_321
I did what seemed right at the time. Same old bull.
AC_BGT_L3_322
But lookin' at you... I remember what it was like to be real lost.
AC_BGT_L3_323
Mr. Dickinson...
AC_BGT_L3_324
I dunno. Maybe bein' real lost ain't so bad.
AC_BGT_L3_325
I see... I've got some thinking to do. A lot of it.
AC_BGT_L3_326
I just... Don't want to regret anything.
AC_BGT_L3_327
Good call. I'm not tryin' to preach, but give it some thought.
AC_BGT_L3_328
You got your freedom, after all.
AC_BGT_L3_331
Lemme guess. You're hidin' your true self for the sake of other folks.
AC_BGT_L3_332
...!
AC_BGT_L3_333
Bullseye.
AC_BGT_L3_334
How... How did you know?
AC_BGT_L3_335
I'm ridin' that horse, too, hoss.
AC_BGT_L3_336
I keep tellin' myself this is what's best for my family.
AC_BGT_L3_337
I've shied away from my true feelings for years and years.
AC_BGT_L3_338
Look where it got me. Separate homes. What a joke.
AC_BGT_L3_339
I always thought that, as long as I kept quiet, things would work out...
AC_BGT_L3_340
But it hurts too much. I haven't even told my parents.
AC_BGT_L3_341
You don't need to tell anyone anything you don't wanna.
AC_BGT_L3_342
But if holdin' it in hurts, that's a UMA of a different color.
AC_BGT_L3_343
I know how hard it is to really trust someone, even when they're real close.
AC_BGT_L3_344
Trust, huh...?
AC_BGT_L3_345
I guess...
vkyk401demoy_0_bgt
A duel, I suppose.
vbgt400demoy_0_kyk
I'm gonna learn... the secret of your strength!
AC_BGT_L3_401
I can't believe it... Your power is limitless!
AC_BGT_L3_402
You flatter me. I owe my strength to the power of Gears.
AC_BGT_L3_403
So, when you went public about Gears... Was it scary?
AC_BGT_L3_404
Weren't you afraid of what people would say...?
AC_BGT_L3_405
No, I wasn't afraid.
AC_BGT_L3_406
I didn't want to lie to myself or to my family.
AC_BGT_L3_407
That's all.
AC_BGT_L3_408
That's all...?
AC_BGT_L3_409
Indeed. That was the most important thing to me.
AC_BGT_L3_410
...I suppose you find that hard to believe.
AC_BGT_L3_411
N-No! I mean, I'm impressed.
AC_BGT_L3_412
I wish... I could be like you.
AC_BGT_L3_413
You are strong enough. All that remains is to decide.
AC_BGT_L3_414
Y-Yessir...!
vkyk401demoz_0_bgt
In that case, let's make this a serious duel.
vbgt400demoz_0_kyk
I'm rigged and ready!
AC_BGT_L3_501
Have I convinced you yet?
AC_BGT_L3_502
No matter what others think, I will not change.
AC_BGT_L3_503
Not even if this body turns to Gear.
AC_BGT_L3_504
...No matter what others think, huh?
AC_BGT_L3_505
I'll admit that still scares me a little...
AC_BGT_L3_506
But I want to live as my true self.
AC_BGT_L3_507
At least that's kind of how I feel now that I've watched you.
AC_BGT_L3_508
I'm glad to be of help.
AC_BGT_L3_509
Come visit Illyria if you need anything.
AC_BGT_L3_510
Dizzy will be happy to see you, too.
AC_BGT_L3_511
Of course! I'll have lots of new yo-yo tricks to show you!
AC_BGT_L3_512
Thank you... Truly.
vsin400demoa_0
Let's see what you got.
vsin400demoa_0_bkn
Learn what, moves? Yeah, a few!
vsin650demoa_0_cos
Hah, does it taste better than sugar water?
vsin400demoa_0_dll
Huh? Not sure I understand, but thanks!
vsin400demoa_0_kyk
Wait, what's a rhythm tick?
vsin400demoa_0_leo
Hoh yeah! I can super-jet-respect that, Mister!
vsin400demoa_0_ram
Oh, that? It was so tasty, I flipped!
vsin400demoa_0_sin
And for dinner? Steak again!
vsin650demoa_0_sol
I'm five years old and full grown, Old Man!
vsin400demoa_0_tst
You're not bloodthirsty, but you're scarier than my Old Man... I'll still win, though.
vsin400demob_0
Let's get this over with. Mom's waiting.
vsin400demob_0_sin
Who knows? Just felt like bein' E.X. Massive!
vsin400democ_0
Energetic folks are great, but strong folks are even better!
vsin401demoa_0
If you need me to go easy on ya, just say the word!
vsin401demoa_0_bkn
I'm not losing today!
vsin651demoa_0_cos
Don't you know? Heroes always show up late!
vsin401demoa_0_dll
Aw, man! Do I really have to babysit?
vsin401demoa_0_kyk
Dad, have you ever had "chili"?^n;It's a super-secret hero feast Old Man made for me! 
vsin401demoa_0_leo
I've got way, way more freedom than Dad's got!
vsin401demoa_0_ram
Ready when you are, Ram!
vsin401demoa_0_sin
Steak for breakfast, burgers for lunch!
vsin651demoa_0_sol
You're not ready for me today, Old Man!
vsin401demob_0
I'm real serious, so get ready to HOLD it!
vsin401demob_0_sin
What's this supposed to be, cosplay?
vsin401democ_0
I'll say sorry in advance... in case I make you cry!
vsin402demoa_0
The battle's over! We're friends now, right?
vsin402demoa_0_kyk
You can count on your boy sometime, y'know?
vsin402demoa_0_ram
Heh heh! Let's do this again tomorrow!
vsin402demoa_0_sin
Ha, suckaaa! Your burger's mine!
vsin402demoa_0_sol
How's that, Old Man! You "buzzed" yet?
vsin402demob_1
Aw, yeah! I nailed it!
vsin402demob_0
Sorry! I guess I'm the grownup here!
vsin402democ_0
Best. Victory. Ever!
vsin650demoa_0_ram
Oh, that? It was so tasty, I flipped!
vsin651demoa_0_ram
Ready when you are, Ram!
vsin400demoa_0_bed
Huh? Not sure I understand, but thanks!
vsin401demoa_0_bed
Aw, man! Do I really have to babysit?
vzat401demov_0_sin
Ah, the son of the First King. What brings you to me?
vsin400demov_0_zat
C'mon, no need to be so formal!
AC_SIN_L1_101
What are you doing here?
AC_SIN_L1_102
A lost kid asked me to show them around...
AC_SIN_L1_103
Said they needed money, too... Huh? Where'd they go?
AC_SIN_L1_104
It might've been a scam. This isn't the safest of areas.
AC_SIN_L1_105
I won't tell you to trust no-one, but try to be a little more cautious.
AC_SIN_L1_106
I mean, you never know, right?
AC_SIN_L1_107
As long as I'm helping people in need...
AC_SIN_L1_108
...Who cares if I get tricked now and then?
AC_SIN_L1_109
Hm...
AC_SIN_L1_111
What are you doing here? This isn't the safest of areas.
AC_SIN_L1_112
Showing a kid around. I think they're lost!
AC_SIN_L1_113
They were right here a minute ago... Hey, where's my wallet?
AC_SIN_L1_114
I hate to say it, but I think both wallet and kid are gone.
AC_SIN_L1_115
I'm afraid the generous make the easiest marks.
AC_SIN_L1_116
Well, hey. Maybe they need it more than I do.
AC_SIN_L1_117
You never know, until you find out.
AC_SIN_L1_118
...I suppose not.
AC_SIN_L1_201
It seems you are in need.
AC_SIN_L1_202
Oh! Right on time!
AC_SIN_L1_211
Thanks for the save.
AC_SIN_L1_212
Don't mention it.
AC_SIN_L1_213
So why'd you help me? I'm just a nobody.
AC_SIN_L1_214
Well, if I had to give a reason...
AC_SIN_L1_215
You... just looked like you could use the help.
vkyk401demow_0_sin
Finished with your errands?
vsin400demow_0_kyk
Ultimate-critical-finished!
AC_SIN_L1_401
Well, I'm all done for the day. Let's spar!
AC_SIN_L1_402
Couldn't hurt to move the ol' bod once in a while, Dad!
AC_SIN_L1_403
You're right. It has been a while.
AC_SIN_L1_404
Here I come.
AC_SIN_L1_411
Wait. I'm getting a call.
AC_SIN_L1_412
What is it? Yes, he's here.
AC_SIN_L1_413
...I'll pass that along.
AC_SIN_L1_414
Haven't you forgotten something, Sin?
AC_SIN_L1_415
Hmm? Lessee... My homework's all done... Uhhhmmm....
AC_SIN_L1_416
Your mother is asking about the groceries.
AC_SIN_L1_417
Aw, man! I screwed that up!
AC_SIN_L1_418
All that talk, and you couldn't manage a shopping trip?
AC_SIN_L1_419
It seems Elphelt took care of it on your behalf. She was worried about you.
AC_SIN_L1_420
Hah... I'm super-jet-beat...
AC_SIN_L1_421
Wait a moment.
AC_SIN_L1_422
Yes, it's me.
AC_SIN_L1_423
What? I see, Dizzy. Understood.
AC_SIN_L1_424
Sin. Didn't your mother ask you to go shopping?
AC_SIN_L1_425
Dah! Uh-Umm... That... does sound familiar.
AC_SIN_L1_426
What was I supposed to buy? Milk... Um, what else...?
AC_SIN_L1_427
Sin.
AC_SIN_L1_428
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!!
AC_SIN_L1_429
Your strength hasn't changed you one bit.
AC_SIN_L1_430
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
vkyk401demox_0_sin
Try not to hurt yourself.
vsin400demox_0_kyk
That's my line, Dad!
AC_SIN_L2_401
Can you handle things from here?
AC_SIN_L2_402
I told you, I'll be totally fine...
AC_SIN_L2_403
Sin, this is where your habits led you.
AC_SIN_L2_404
Nngh... Fine, I'll take the L.
AC_SIN_L2_405
But y'know, I'm not gonna be a kid forever!
AC_SIN_L2_406
Lemme show you just how much I've grown.
AC_SIN_L2_411
You really have grown.
AC_SIN_L2_412
Yeah, a little. I even helped someone out today.
AC_SIN_L2_413
I did lose 'em at one point, though. But I think they got what they needed.
AC_SIN_L2_414
A deed so selfless, it cost you your wallet.
AC_SIN_L2_415
Ulp... P-Please don't go there.
AC_SIN_L2_416
But no harm, no foul, right? I'll keep an eye on it next time.
AC_SIN_L2_417
As your father, I only hope for your safety.
AC_SIN_L2_418
For my sake, please keep that close to your heart.
AC_SIN_L2_419
That's all I have to say.
AC_SIN_L2_420
You're not mad at me, Dad?
AC_SIN_L2_421
I have no reason to be.
AC_SIN_L2_422
Really?
AC_SIN_L2_423
Really.
AC_SIN_L2_424
Now let's head home. Your mother is waiting.
AC_SIN_L2_425
Yeah! I wonder what's for dinner!
AC_SIN_L3_301
Is it coincidence, or is it destiny?
AC_SIN_L3_302
Whatever happened to a simple "hello"?!
AC_SIN_L3_311
The child you helped earlier was scamming you...
AC_SIN_L3_312
If I told you that, would you act any differently?
AC_SIN_L3_313
Why should I?
AC_SIN_L3_314
Who says scammers don't need help, too?
AC_SIN_L3_315
If I see someone in need, I'll help them.
AC_SIN_L3_316
...I see.
AC_SIN_L3_317
I bet you've done your share of bad stuff, too.
AC_SIN_L3_318
But if everyone just cut you off 'cause of it, that's even worse!
AC_SIN_L3_319
So if you ever need anything, come talk to me!
AC_SIN_L3_320
Heh heh... I appreciate the concern.
AC_SIN_L3_321
Man, I can never tell if you're happy or not.
AC_SIN_L3_322
I am happy. I never thought I could be so moved.
AC_SIN_L3_331
I looked into that child. They're a known con artist.
AC_SIN_L3_332
Huh? What child?
AC_SIN_L3_333
The child you assisted before.
AC_SIN_L3_334
They make targets out of kind, trusting souls like you.
AC_SIN_L3_335
You should be a little more careful from now on.
AC_SIN_L3_336
Well, I get what you're saying...
AC_SIN_L3_337
But hey! Maybe the kid really needed the cash.
AC_SIN_L3_338
No way for me to know the truth anyway, so why stress over it?
AC_SIN_L3_339
Can't let a chance to help someone slip by, right?
AC_SIN_L3_340
A chance...
AC_SIN_L3_341
Well said. That's... One way to look at it.
vkyk401demoy_0_sin
You're looking down.
vsin400demoy_0_kyk
Yeah. Can I shake it off with you?
AC_SIN_L3_401
Do you feel better now?
AC_SIN_L3_402
Not really. Can you get a little more... serious?
vkyk401demoz_0_sin
Don't overdo it, Sin.
vsin400demoz_0_kyk
I won't if you won't!
AC_SIN_L3_501
So, still troubled?
AC_SIN_L3_502
Nope! I got an ultra-perfect answer!
AC_SIN_L3_503
I figured out I shouldn't think too hard about stuff!
AC_SIN_L3_504
All that thinking, and that's your answer? Oh, Sin.
AC_SIN_L3_505
I could overthink whether or not to help one person...^n;or I could skip the thinking and help two people instead!
AC_SIN_L3_506
Y'know, I think that just feels way better.
AC_SIN_L3_507
You're right. That's a good way to walk through life.
AC_SIN_L3_508
Heh heh! Thanks, Dad. I owe it all to you and Mom!
AC_SIN_L3_509
Well, Sin... You really have grown.
vdll400demoa_0_sin

vdll401demoa_0_sin

vbed400demoa_0
Aw, I'm gonna be late getting home...
vbed400demob_0
Would you mind leaving me alone?
vbed400democ_0
Why'd I have to get wrapped up in this?
vbed400demoa_1
I told you, I don't have time for this!
vbed400demob_1
Y-You're not gonna back down, are you?
vbed400democ_1
Why... Why can't I control my power?
vbed400demoa_2
You won't last for long with a violent streak like that.
vbed400demoa_1_bkn
I was just getting to it...
vbed400demoa_1_ram
As long as you don't break it...
vbed400demoa_1_sin
I'm older than you are...
vbed401demob_0_bed
You could've at least been my brother...
vbed400demob_0_bed
...Then we could have talked again.
vbed400demob_1_bkn
Don't you think it's cute, though?
vbed400democ_1_bkn
Fine, but only today. It's dangerous.
vbed401demoa_0
Please let me go. Big Sis is gonna throw a fit.
vbed401demob_0
You can't stop it. So move.
vbed401democ_0
Sorry. Whatever happens is on you.
vbed401demoa_1
We were getting along so nicely, too...
vbed401demob_1
It's too late now, but... I should show them I've done SOME self-care...
vbed401democ_1
Please run away now... For the sake of our friendship.
vbed401demoa_2
Please... Get out of my way.
vbed401democ_2
Too bad it's not a dream. I could've stopped this.
vbed401demoa_0_bed
Would you... do the laundry for me?
vbed400demoa_0_bed
I'll think about it... if you clean my room.
vbed401demoa_1_bkn
Ugh, this again...
vbed401demoa_1_ram
I'm trusting you, here.
vbed401demob_1_bkn
Hmmmnh...
vbed401democ_1_bkn
I... I wanna go home.
vbed402demoa_0
Let's get going.
vbed402demob_0
Thanks.
vbed402democ_0
I'm glad you're okay.
vbed402demoa_1
Sorry. I hope you don't hate me now.
vbed402demob_1
No hard feelings, okay? For both of us.
vbed402democ_1
This is just an ordinary dream. Sleep well.
vbed402demoa_2
Are you happy now? You almost made me miss my curfew.
vbed402democ_2
How'd you miss the power difference?
vbed402demoa_1_bkn
Oh, I went way too far... She's gonna be pissed...
vbed402demob_1_bkn
Your power is something deeper than just strength or skill...
vbed402democ_1_bkn
I win... which means donuts for dinner.
vbed402demoa_2_cos
I'll never acknowledge an inch of you.
vbed402demoa_1_ram
I could use strength like yours...
vbed402demoa_1_sin
H-Hand over that ice cream, and I'll help you with your homework...
vbed401demoa_1_sin
I wish I could be as obnoxious and obstinate as you are.
vbkn401demov_0_bed
Hey! Hold it right there!
vbed400demov_1_bkn
H-Help me...!
AC_BED_L1_101
Delilah, any idea what's goin' on?
AC_BED_L1_102
No... I'd just had dinner, that's all...
AC_BED_L1_103
So why'd this piece'a junk go berserk?
AC_BED_L1_104
Was it hungry or somethin'?
AC_BED_L1_105
Hey, wait!
AC_BED_L1_106
Dammit, this bed's a real piece'a work!
AC_BED_L1_111
Something's wrong... I've never seen it act like this before.
AC_BED_L1_112
Brother's program shouldn't run haywire like that...
AC_BED_L1_113
Let's save the family talk for later.
AC_BED_L1_114
We got a bed to deal with-- 
AC_BED_L1_115
HEY!
AC_BED_L1_116
Wait!
AC_BED_L1_201
Tch.
AC_BED_L1_202
B-Big Sis!
AC_BED_L1_211
Are you hurt, Delilah?
AC_BED_L1_212
That thing doesn't look berserk or broken to me. I think it's up to somethin'.
AC_BED_L1_213
Y-Yeah... You're right. It won't hurt us.
AC_BED_L1_214
Can I keep an eye on it for a bit longer? It's the only thing Brother left behind...
AC_BED_L1_215
Suit yourself. Don't stay out too late.
vram401demow_1_bed
What happened?
vbed400demow_1_ram
Um... I woke up, had some food, took a nap, and now... this.
AC_BED_L1_401
His bed looks like it wants to fight.
AC_BED_L1_402
Okay. Let's fight.
AC_BED_L1_403
But--!
AC_BED_L1_404
If that's what he wants, I don't mind.
AC_BED_L1_411
St-Stop, everybody!
AC_BED_L1_412
Don't break my brother's bed!
AC_BED_L1_413
Huh?
AC_BED_L1_414
There's a close shave.
AC_BED_L1_415
D-Did it stop?
AC_BED_L1_416
Looks like it. What was that about?
AC_BED_L1_417
I don't know. But I'm glad it didn't break.
AC_BED_L1_418
It's not that I wanted to break it.
AC_BED_L1_419
...
AC_BED_L1_420
(Sigh) We're movin' out, Delilah.
AC_BED_L1_421
Don't forget yer bed.
AC_BED_L1_422
...'Kay!
AC_BED_L1_431
St-Stop it!
AC_BED_L1_432
You can't take any more damage!
AC_BED_L1_433
Oh... It stopped...
AC_BED_L1_434
Th-Thankfully...
AC_BED_L1_435
No signs of aggression. You're safe now.
AC_BED_L1_436
Uh... Th-Thank you very much.
AC_BED_L1_437
This bed is... all I have left of my brother.
AC_BED_L1_438
It must be precious to you. Take good care of it.
vram401demox_1_bed
What's going on?
vbed400demox_1_ram
It's not what it looks like! I was just laying around, then--
AC_BED_L2_401
Did you seek me out to have a fight?
AC_BED_L2_402
I don't understand. But if it's what you want, let's fight.
AC_BED_L2_403
I want to know his reason for leaving that behind, too.
AC_BED_L2_404
Miss Ramlethal...
AC_BED_L2_411
Stop! No more!
AC_BED_L2_412
It... It stopped...
AC_BED_L2_413
What the hell?
AC_BED_L2_414
But... Why? It's never stopped before...
AC_BED_L2_415
Because it's always focused on protecting you.
AC_BED_L2_416
But now, it wants something.
AC_BED_L2_417
Somethin' from you?
AC_BED_L2_418
It's looking for opponents who are strong... or powerful by some other definition.
AC_BED_L2_419
It won't be recharged or repaired. It isn't programmed to be.
AC_BED_L2_420
You're sayin' it's tryin' to get wrecked?
AC_BED_L2_421
Why...? Wh-What's the point?
AC_BED_L2_422
Maybe he wanted it to be destroyed.
AC_BED_L2_423
But you managed to actually stop it.
AC_BED_L2_424
I don't know why, but there must be some meaning.
AC_BED_L2_425
Meaning...
AC_BED_L2_426
Brother left me a... meaning?
AC_BED_L3_301
Time for good little girls to go home.
AC_BED_L3_302
What time, exactly? And "good' by what standard...? Oh... Nevermind.
AC_BED_L3_311
Nope. Uh-uh. I see what you're after.
AC_BED_L3_312
Go find someone else. I ain't havin' it.
AC_BED_L3_313
Huh...?
AC_BED_L3_314
My sword's not gonna give you your easy way out.
AC_BED_L3_315
Delilah, c'mon home when you've had enough.
AC_BED_L3_316
Don't forget it's your turn to cook.
AC_BED_L3_317
Fine...
AC_BED_L3_318
Forgettin' something?
AC_BED_L3_319
I-I mean, yes ma'am!
AC_BED_L3_320
See it through to the end.
AC_BED_L3_321
Man, you're a pesky gadget...
AC_BED_L3_322
But lose you or not, it's a call she's gotta make.
AC_BED_L3_331
Tch... Would it kill you to play it straight for once?
AC_BED_L3_332
Ya gotta be honest with your siblings.
AC_BED_L3_333
You're one to talk, Sis.
AC_BED_L3_334
Cram it.
AC_BED_L3_335
Listen, Delilah. This thing's not gonna attack you.
AC_BED_L3_336
...
AC_BED_L3_337
But that doesn't mean you're completely safe.
AC_BED_L3_338
Right.
AC_BED_L3_339
You're still gonna stick with it, ain'tcha?
AC_BED_L3_340
Mhm.
AC_BED_L3_341
Two conditions: If things get outta hand, you run. And you get home before supper.
AC_BED_L3_342
...! Got it!
AC_BED_L3_343
Thank you, Big Sis!
AC_BED_L3_344
You're really lookin' out for your sister, huh?
AC_BED_L3_345
Wish you were a little less selfish.
vram401demoy_1_bed
You...
vbed400demoy_1_ram
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
AC_BED_L3_401
Is it really programmed to fight so recklessly?
AC_BED_L3_402
As far as I can tell, it's not a bug...
AC_BED_L3_403
With my powers waning, too, I just couldn't stop it...
AC_BED_L3_404
Ah, not again!
vram401demoz_1_bed
Target threat level increased. I will silence you.
vbed400demoz_1_ram
S-Silence?!
AC_BED_L3_501
St-Stop, you two! Don't break the bed!
AC_BED_L3_502
It... It's my Brother's!
AC_BED_L3_503
...! Right. I thought as much.
AC_BED_L3_504
It... stopped?
AC_BED_L3_505
Don't worry. It won't run off anymore.
AC_BED_L3_506
Thank god... But why?
AC_BED_L3_507
Probably for your sake.
AC_BED_L3_508
For your sake, it wanted to go far away to be destroyed.
AC_BED_L3_509
I.. I never wanted that...
AC_BED_L3_510
Right. That's why it stopped.
AC_BED_L3_511
You stopped its self-destruction somehow.
AC_BED_L3_512
Perhaps you were... "unique" to him.
AC_BED_L3_513
He taught me about "uniqueness," too. Before he left.
AC_BED_L3_514
...
AC_BED_L3_515
Miss Ramlethal...
AC_BED_L3_516
Could you tell me my brother's story?
AC_BED_L3_517
I want to know what Romeo's been through.
vask401demov_0_ask
Repeat after me: "I'm bored."
vask400demov_5_ask
I have no right to utter such words.
AC_ASK_L1_101
This was a failure. We're not meant for such... rigorous recreation.
AC_ASK_L1_102
I agree, but that's not news to you, is it?
AC_ASK_L1_103
You ARE me, after all.
AC_ASK_L1_104
I suppose... But if so, shouldn't you already know my intentions?
AC_ASK_L1_105
...
AC_ASK_L1_106
That's strange... We should be identical...
AC_ASK_L1_107
But we're not. I'm chattier than you are. You made me that way.
AC_ASK_L1_108
And I can't make heads or tails of right and wrong. It's... vexing.
AC_ASK_L1_109
Vexing? Ah... I forgot to reconfigure your real-time settings.
AC_ASK_L1_110
Sorry about that. Your personality formation and experience points are out of alignment.
AC_ASK_L1_111
Heh heh heh.
AC_ASK_L1_112
You know, you don't seem like the type to destroy all human life.
AC_ASK_L1_113
You don't have to laugh.
AC_ASK_L1_114
Come with me.
AC_ASK_L1_121
Here we are--Just the two of us, in a galactic palace built for four hundred.
AC_ASK_L1_122
Nothing wrong with a change of scenery, eh?
AC_ASK_L1_123
Ha ha... I can't say I see the significance.
AC_ASK_L1_124
No? Well, I beg to differ.
AC_ASK_L1_125
Otherwise... I might never learn why you created me.
AC_ASK_L1_126
...Um, well... About that.
AC_ASK_L1_127
The Valentine sisters, formed by the Universal Will, were perfect beings.
AC_ASK_L1_128
I hadn't seen such immaculate synthetic life since the Frasco specimen.
AC_ASK_L1_129
So you wanted to try it for yourself.
AC_ASK_L1_130
At least you're honest... if ethically bankrupt.
AC_ASK_L1_131
Let me guess... Do you resent me?
AC_ASK_L1_132
No need to worry about that. Unless you resent yourself.
AC_ASK_L1_133
Now, why don't we kill a little more time?
AC_ASK_L1_201
Not much of a fighter, eh?
AC_ASK_L1_202
Do I really need to answer that?
AC_ASK_L1_203
Anyhow... They're all simulations?
AC_ASK_L1_204
Right. I made them based on our memories.
AC_ASK_L1_205
Except for a few I had to borrow from books.
AC_ASK_L1_206
Okay, I see what you're saying.
AC_ASK_L1_207
It's better than creating actual life, is that it?
AC_ASK_L1_208
Not at all. I just had no reason to recreate them myself.
AC_ASK_L1_209
Now, watch your opponent carefully... and be ready to reconceptualize.
AC_ASK_L1_211
You mentioned reconceptualization...^n;It seems I don't quite get it yet.
AC_ASK_L1_212
Tell me: What is god, to us?
AC_ASK_L1_213
Science.
AC_ASK_L1_214
Yes. We believed in logic and reason.
AC_ASK_L1_215
But I realized, at this rate, we're bound to become apostate.
AC_ASK_L1_216
We need to... step it up.
AC_ASK_L1_217
Desperate times, desperate measures, eh?
AC_ASK_L1_218
I'm well aware I'm no perfect human being.
AC_ASK_L1_219
There.
AC_ASK_L1_220
That line of thinking is most unscientific.
AC_ASK_L1_221
How could an imperfect human even know perfection?
AC_ASK_L1_222
...So I'm searching for something I can't even recognize?
AC_ASK_L1_223
So close. But not quite the answer I'm after.
AC_ASK_L1_224
You need more time to feel it out. You're on your own from here.
AC_ASK_L1_225
I hate to admit it...
AC_ASK_L1_226
But I'm stumped.
vask401demow_0_ask
Welcome.
vask400demow_5_ask
...Me again?
AC_ASK_L1_401
I'm about ready for an explanation.
AC_ASK_L1_402
The words I'm about to say are also within you.
AC_ASK_L1_403
Ah, sorry. This Asuka was based on myself.
AC_ASK_L1_404
Everyone I've fought so far was a simulation that you made. I get that.
AC_ASK_L1_405
But if this is a version of me, I know he'd rather talk things out.
AC_ASK_L1_406
Right. But Frederick taught all of us what it means to fight.
AC_ASK_L1_407
In other words... Our emotional experience has exceeded our vocabulary?
AC_ASK_L1_408
If that is your inquiry...
AC_ASK_L1_409
...does it really call for an answer?
AC_ASK_L1_411
Wait... Let's settle the score.
AC_ASK_L1_412
Does our fighting have any meaning?
AC_ASK_L1_413
To be honest, I'm worn out... and didn't quite enjoy hitting myself.
AC_ASK_L1_414
But isn't this what you--I mean, we--wanted?
AC_ASK_L1_415
No. It's a means to an end. He decides if we got what we wanted.
AC_ASK_L1_416
Who, me?
AC_ASK_L1_417
...Haah.
AC_ASK_L1_418
I don't know what the purpose is, but I do know one thing.
AC_ASK_L1_419
All versions of me left the conclusion up to others.
AC_ASK_L1_420
You made me. You knew this would happen.
AC_ASK_L1_421
I respect you for it. You know what this means, right?
AC_ASK_L1_422
Sure. It took a long, strange trip to get there, though.
AC_ASK_L1_423
Let's call it a day.
AC_ASK_L1_424
Next time, I'll give you my real message.
AC_ASK_L1_431
I wonder if this is it...
AC_ASK_L1_432
What was my other self trying to accomplish?
AC_ASK_L1_433
The answers you seek are all inside you.
AC_ASK_L1_434
...What's the word?
AC_ASK_L1_435
Frustrating. But it does sound like what I'd say.
AC_ASK_L1_436
I was recreated from another version of myself.
AC_ASK_L1_437
I may have a thought that didn't occur to you. Should I share?
AC_ASK_L1_438
By all means.
AC_ASK_L1_439
You don't like yourself.
AC_ASK_L1_440
So you made a mirror to see the reason... and change it.
AC_ASK_L1_441
Oh, I created you guys for more selfish reasons than that.
AC_ASK_L1_442
Still, you must have considered it would end in facing yourself.
AC_ASK_L1_443
But my other self noticed something beyond ^n;that--thanks to your slight tweak to his personality.
AC_ASK_L1_444
He realized we'd all grow old staring at the mirror.
AC_ASK_L1_445
C-Can you put that a little more directly?
AC_ASK_L1_446
Now is not the time.
AC_ASK_L1_447
I'm starting to understand...
AC_ASK_L1_448
...why Frederick and the rest never seemed too happy to talk to me.
vask401demox_0_ask
I never thought I would make it to me.
vask400demox_5_ask
I sure didn't see this coming.
AC_ASK_L2_401
All the simulations thus far were quite well-made.
AC_ASK_L2_402
But isn't this redundant?
AC_ASK_L2_403
I tuned him for combat.
AC_ASK_L2_404
Fighting will show us some sort of answer.
AC_ASK_L2_405
There are two possible conclusions...
AC_ASK_L2_406
One that I'm hoping for.
AC_ASK_L2_407
And the other?
AC_ASK_L2_408
I'd like to believe you're not hoping for it.
AC_ASK_L2_411
It seems like my wish came true.
AC_ASK_L2_412
Are you going to tell me what your wish was?
AC_ASK_L2_413
Your duty, and your penance for throwing the world into chaos...
AC_ASK_L2_414
You were stuck between those two mutually exclusive ends.
AC_ASK_L2_415
As a scientist, and as a human.
AC_ASK_L2_416
So why did you create me?
AC_ASK_L2_417
I was frightened for a moment there... but you prevailed.
AC_ASK_L2_418
I want to exist.
AC_ASK_L2_419
...
AC_ASK_L2_420
Even so, without a firm scientific basis, you'll just go in circles.
AC_ASK_L2_421
Just because something isn't proven doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
AC_ASK_L2_422
You think it's unscientific to deny the value of feelings?
AC_ASK_L2_423
I know it. And I'll prove it.
AC_ASK_L2_424
I might well exist to do so.
AC_ASK_L2_425
Heh... There must be a more natural way to reach an understanding.
AC_ASK_L2_426
Heh heh! Maybe we can disprove gravity next.
AC_ASK_L3_301
Isn't it about time you told me what you're after?
AC_ASK_L3_302
Why not? Let's get started.
AC_ASK_L3_303
I have to fight you again?
AC_ASK_L3_311
That's interesting...
AC_ASK_L3_312
It's hard to explain, but you were fighting me...
AC_ASK_L3_313
...not against yourself.
AC_ASK_L3_314
If you notice the difference, you're making good progress.
AC_ASK_L3_315
I'm sure you'll do fine without me from now on.
AC_ASK_L3_316
Don't forget all the people you fought on the way here.
AC_ASK_L3_317
They may have been my creations, but that makes them your creations, too.
AC_ASK_L3_318
You're not the monster you think you are.
AC_ASK_L3_319
Tch. Are you kidding me?
AC_ASK_L3_320
You made me... chatty.
AC_ASK_L3_321
I found hobbies, interests... optimism.
AC_ASK_L3_322
I wondered why... and then it hit me.
AC_ASK_L3_323
I... I...
AC_ASK_L3_324
I had nothing to do with any of it!
AC_ASK_L3_325
Isn't that what you wanted to teach me?
AC_ASK_L3_326
But look. I can't forget your whole history of feeling.
AC_ASK_L3_327
Introverted... Disagreeable...
AC_ASK_L3_328
The truth--reality--interested you most. But no one wanted to hear it.
AC_ASK_L3_329
The world was an uncomfortable place...
AC_ASK_L3_330
And you had no one to blame for that.
AC_ASK_L3_331
You destroyed the world. The people you love. All of it.
AC_ASK_L3_332
...Okay. I get it.
AC_ASK_L3_333
I'm sorry I made you say all of that.
AC_ASK_L3_334
That response gets an F.
AC_ASK_L3_335
Huh?
AC_ASK_L3_336
I know you can't affirm yourself.
AC_ASK_L3_337
But at least tell me you'll keep walking. Even if you lose your way.
AC_ASK_L3_338
As long as one person out there cares about you...
AC_ASK_L3_339
It's worth it just to try and keep them happy.
AC_ASK_L3_340
I didn't create you to be some living epitaph...
AC_ASK_L3_341
I want to believe that.
AC_ASK_L3_342
That's why you must come home alive.
AC_ASK_L3_343
I never figured things would take such a drastic turn...
AC_ASK_L3_351
I get it now. You are indeed different from me.
AC_ASK_L3_352
Yes, but making you see that isn't what's important.
AC_ASK_L3_353
In that case, I don't have the answer yet.
AC_ASK_L3_354
I thought about why you made me.
AC_ASK_L3_355
One, you wanted to perfect a synthetic life form... ^n;Two, you wanted someone to talk to.
AC_ASK_L3_356
Those, I'm sure of. It's no use lying to me.
AC_ASK_L3_357
The last is a hypothesis...
AC_ASK_L3_358
You don't like yourself.
AC_ASK_L3_359
That's not a hypothesis.
AC_ASK_L3_360
The question is... why not?
AC_ASK_L3_361
Why not, huh?
AC_ASK_L3_362
I can't understand other people's feelings. And I can't stand that I can't.
AC_ASK_L3_363
I'm just a pathetic, ineffectual nerd... I don't measure up to them.
AC_ASK_L3_364
Nerd is just a label. That's not why you don't have friends.
AC_ASK_L3_365
And you're lying about not understanding them. ^n;Didn't you see everyone you fought?
AC_ASK_L3_366
Great simulations, if I may say so myself.
AC_ASK_L3_367
But that's not the reason I'm looking for.
AC_ASK_L3_368
Hmm... Can I give up?
AC_ASK_L3_369
Me, I happen to like myself.
AC_ASK_L3_370
Once I realized why, I had two hypotheses.
AC_ASK_L3_371
I want to put them to the test.
vask401demoy_0_ask
I didn't expect to see you here.
vask400demoy_5_ask
That was my line...
AC_ASK_L3_401
To think you made me disable my limiters...
AC_ASK_L3_402
I'm tuned for combat. Your chances of winning are theoretically zero.
AC_ASK_L3_403
I miscalculated. Are you really out to kill me?
vask401demoz_0_ask
Can I assume you're prepared for this?
vask400demoz_5_ask
No, I'm not! That's the right answer, right?
AC_ASK_L3_501
Most impressive. The other me will be delighted.
AC_ASK_L3_502
I could say the same thing to you.
AC_ASK_L3_503
...But it's not really the time for it.
AC_ASK_L3_504
Wait... I haven't come up with a good parting line yet.
AC_ASK_L3_505
...Ha ha.
AC_ASK_L3_506
It's not like anyone actually cares about this fight.
AC_ASK_L3_507
But I think I understand my master's take on existence a little better.
AC_ASK_L3_508
Just a little.
AC_ASK_L3_509
...A teeny, tiny bit.
vask400demoa_0
Um, could you say that again? I was lost in thought...
vask400demoa_0_anj
Dancing? Alas, I have no practical experience.
vask400demoa_0_ask
Sounds like a plan.
vask400demoa_5_ask
Sounds like a plan.
vask400demoa_0_cos
Turn it down a bit, Teacher.
vask400demoa_0_jko
I do, if I may be so bold.
vask400demoa_0_sol
I'm Asuka.
vask400demob_0
Improvisation may trump a perfect plan... but I'll take my chances.
vask400demob_0_anj
Another ambush? Really?
vask400demob_0_ask
Yes. Let's finish this.
vask400demob_5_ask
Yes. Let's finish this.
vask400demob_0_cos
I tried applying your Gaia Turing, too.
vask400demob_0_jko
Are my tricks or treats not good enough? That's... kind of sad.
vask400demob_0_sol
Ah, so you can tell, can you?
vask400democ_0
Quiet, please. I'm calculating my chance of survival.
vask400democ_0_anj
No, but you'll wish we had one.
vask400democ_0_ask
Honestly, I'd like to stop.
vask400democ_5_ask
Honestly, I'd like to stop.
vask400democ_0_cos
It's Asuka. For now, at least.
vask400democ_0_jko
All of my time is for this.
vask400democ_0_sol
You're innately conscious of me. Wonderful.
vask401demoa_0
I'm sure I'll be done before my next breath.

Can't you just say hello?
vask401demoa_5_ask
If this gets scary, I'm quitting.
vask401demoa_0_ask
If this gets scary, I'm quitting.
vask401demoa_0_cos
The unprovable can be proven. Too bad you're the result.
vask401demoa_0_jko
I'm sure you see right through me.
vask401demoa_0_sol
How goes life in hiding?
vask401demob_0
If I give up now, will you let me be?
vask401demob_0_anj
Still have something to ask me?
vask401demob_5_ask
Is this a good time?
vask401demob_0_ask
Is this a good time?
vask401demob_0_cos
Let's run some tests to see how immortal you really are.
vask401demob_0_jko
Help me gather some data.
vask401demob_0_sol
Well, someone hasn't changed.
vask401democ_0
Commencing Battle Method Turing test. Subjects: both combatants.
vask401democ_0_anj
Commencing collection.

How much more will you collect?
vask401democ_0_ask
How much more will you collect?
vask401democ_0_cos
I could destroy you with a strangelet.
vask401democ_0_jko
Hi. It's good to see you well.
vask401democ_0_sol
If only we were meeting under happier circumstances.
vask402demoa_0
Beating people sure is hard. It's far easier to destroy them.
vask402demoa_0_anj
I'm sure there are more peaceful ways to have a conversation.
vask402demoa_0_cos
When knowledge and experience don't work, absurdity just might.
vask402demoa_0_sol
You'll be much stronger once you're free of discord.
vask402demob_0
How rude of me. I haven't an ounce of fighting spirit.
vask402demob_0_cos
You know... Neither of us look our best in physical combat.
vask402demob_0_sol
Our fundamental composition is quite similar. That's how I know.
vask402democ_0
Sample gathered. Please cross-reference it with the books.
vask402democ_0_cos
You're an easy read. ^n;You hesitate when I do things you think Asuka wouldn't.
vask402democ_0_sol
I knew the throughput wouldn't be enough, so I added a sequencer.
vask400demoa_5_cos
Rest assured I won't touch any resources ^n;other than your vision and feedback response.
vask400demoa_5_jko
Thanks. He should hear it straight from me.
vask400demoa_5_sol
In a sense. ^n;Outside observers can't percieve anything as it's rendered in your brain.
vask400demob_5_cos
Well, you never taught me how to talk.
vask400demob_5_sol
Your sensory data keeps me in sync with the situation. It's all real to us.
vask400democ_5_cos
It's my show. I don't need to explain my intent, let alone add extra drama.
vask400democ_5_sol
It's all scientifically sound. We'll both feel every blow.
vask401demoa_5_cos
This is teacher versus pupil. Remember?
vask401demoa_5_jko
I'm sure you see right through me.
vask401demoa_5_sol
I'm analyzing some data. Will you help me out?
vask401demob_5_cos
You'll make a rare subject for a Battle Method Turing Test indeed.
vask401demob_5_sol
I've found a new hobby.
vask401democ_5_cos
Do you ever wonder how will intervenes in existence?
vask401democ_5_sol
I'm researching tools for extralinguistic communication.

Alright, we're in sync. Now transmitting via quantum teleportation.

All right, fine. How 'bout we take this to my ship?
vjhn401demob_1

vgio401demoa_0_jhn
Got nothing better to do?
vjhn400demoa_0_gio
I'm plenty busy when there's a lady involved, obviously.
vjhn401demoa_0_gio
Damn, Vernon... Maybe I should run for president.
vgio400demoa_0_jhn
I'm not sure they let pirates on the ticket.

No can do. Can't you tell I love my job?

That's a shame. Seems like it's hell on your shoulders.

If you'd like a change of pace, the Jellyfish Pirates are hiring.

A wild lady and a perfect Johnny. You couldn't paint a better picture.

Well, aren't you an optimist?
AC_JHN_L1_124
Are pessimists more your type?
AC_JHN_L1_125
I like a man who can leave me alone.

Guess that means my charms still have room to grow.
AC_JHN_L1_201
I just can't leave you alone, can I?
AC_JHN_L1_202
Great timing.
AC_JHN_L1_211
Were you losing on purpose?
AC_JHN_L1_212
Every lady needs some time in the spotlight.

Ugh. Sorry I showed up.

Johnny! Explain!
AC_JHN_L1_403
Settle down and hear me out, okay?
AC_JHN_L1_404
You wanna go? We should go.
AC_JHN_L1_405
You're not getting away! Neither of you!
AC_JHN_L1_411
I told you, I was looking for new crewmates!
AC_JHN_L1_412
You're the one who's been whining about the workload.
AC_JHN_L1_413
Is that all?
AC_JHN_L1_414
Honestly, I thought you were just off chasing women...
AC_JHN_L1_415
I guess I was mistaken.
AC_JHN_L1_416
Enh, well, not entirely.
AC_JHN_L1_417
In other words, she nailed it.
AC_JHN_L1_418
Sometimes you gotta break outta your birdcage to see the fluffiest clouds, ^n;don't you agree?
AC_JHN_L1_419
Sure. Just don't tell my boss. Or the president.
AC_JHN_L1_420
Snitch on a lady? What kinda brute do you take me for?
AC_JHN_L1_421
Heh heh.
AC_JHN_L1_422
Hey, no more grown-up talk!
AC_JHN_L1_431
Sorry, Johnny! Are you okay?
AC_JHN_L1_432
Y-Yeah. If I were anyone else, though, all bets'd be off.
AC_JHN_L1_433
You should've told me.^n;I'll help you look for a crew.
AC_JHN_L1_434
Listen. Finding people is one of the hardest missions there is.
AC_JHN_L1_435
Feeling 'em out, reeling 'em in... It's like a battle.
AC_JHN_L1_436
I don't wanna drag my precious family into that snakepit.
AC_JHN_L1_437
Johnny...!
AC_JHN_L1_438
Wait, you're just trying to hook up with a woman!
AC_JHN_L1_439
Y'know, you really are growing up...
vmay401demox_0_jhn
Johnnyyyyyy!
vjhn400demox_0_may
Damn, you're earlier than I expected.
AC_JHN_L2_401
While you were out playing, we were slaying dragons!
AC_JHN_L2_402
Today's the day you're gonna get it!
AC_JHN_L2_403
Why not explain?
AC_JHN_L2_404
If that's all it took, we'd be done already.
AC_JHN_L2_411
I get it... You were just inviting her aboard.
AC_JHN_L2_412
And I've been turning him down the whole time.
AC_JHN_L2_413
Sorry. I thought Johnny was cheating on me.
AC_JHN_L2_414
Cheating? Me? I play it straight with all the ladies.
AC_JHN_L2_415
And again, I've been turning him down.
AC_JHN_L2_416
C'mon, Giovanna! You might as well at least come aboard!
AC_JHN_L2_417
Then I can make it up to you, and everyone'll be happy!
AC_JHN_L2_418
How's the view?
AC_JHN_L2_419
World-class, I guarantee.
AC_JHN_L2_420
I'm interested.
AC_JHN_L2_421
Yippee!
AC_JHN_L2_422
I'm gonna splurge today! On Johnny's dime, of course.
AC_JHN_L2_423
Throw me a bone, here...
AC_JHN_L3_301
You're starting to annoy me.
AC_JHN_L3_302
A real hero doesn't know when to quit.
AC_JHN_L3_311
I just had to come see you.
AC_JHN_L3_312
I had to see what my contrary little kitty was up to.
AC_JHN_L3_313
I'm not "up to" anything. Except being glad I'm not on your ship.
AC_JHN_L3_314
I'm surrounded by busybodies, but at least it's a steady job.
AC_JHN_L3_315
That's all I need. It's more than I could've asked for.
AC_JHN_L3_316
Yeah? Glad to hear it.
AC_JHN_L3_317
I see you haven't changed one bit.
AC_JHN_L3_318
Course not. Look up "ladies' man" in the dictionary, and there's Johnny.
AC_JHN_L3_319
Did you really just say that?
AC_JHN_L3_320
Why, did I stutter?
AC_JHN_L3_321
Somehow, I get the feeling you're serious.
AC_JHN_L3_322
That's right. When am I ever not serious?
AC_JHN_L3_323
Weirdo. But I bet people flock right to the right weirdo.
AC_JHN_L3_351
Whatever you're after, I'm not joining your pirate crew.
AC_JHN_L3_352
Only a fourth-rate fella makes a lady unhappy. ^n;You've turned me down, and that's that.
AC_JHN_L3_353
Then why? Are you that bored?
AC_JHN_L3_354
I just wondered what you've been up to since then. ^n;This "lone wolf" act is nonsense.
AC_JHN_L3_355
Besides that... I'm searching for something.
AC_JHN_L3_356
...Right. From back then.
AC_JHN_L3_357
I'm not alone, by the way. I've got Rei.
AC_JHN_L3_358
I just didn't want to board your ship.
AC_JHN_L3_359
If you can still say so now, that's enough for me.
AC_JHN_L3_360
At the very least, you're a finer woman than you've ever been.
AC_JHN_L3_361
People can change, you know.
AC_JHN_L3_362
I'm sure you've changed, too.
AC_JHN_L3_363
Now here we are. A finer woman and a finer man.
AC_JHN_L3_364
You can say that again.
vmay401demoy_0_jhn
I've been waiting for you, Johnny.
vjhn400demoy_0_may
I'm... not getting a "welcome home" hug, am I?
AC_JHN_L3_401
Forget warm welcomes, that was scalding. My head's spinning.
AC_JHN_L3_402
I saw you, y'know!
AC_JHN_L3_403
I saw you on a date with another woman!
AC_JHN_L3_404
Poor little me. And who's the lady?
AC_JHN_L3_405
You never take me on dates! How come?!
AC_JHN_L3_406
Johnnyyyyyy!
AC_JHN_L3_407
Look, May, calm down. Or are we past that?
AC_JHN_L3_501
How could you? Here I am, worried sick, and you're dating!
AC_JHN_L3_502
Aw, I was just recruiting new shipmates.
AC_JHN_L3_503
C'mon, why jump to conclusions like that?
AC_JHN_L3_504
B-Because... I love you...
AC_JHN_L3_505
All right, all right...
AC_JHN_L3_506
I'm not upset with you or anything. You know that.
AC_JHN_L3_507
Yeah... I know...
AC_JHN_L3_508
A little misunderstanding only makes our love stronger, right?
AC_JHN_L3_509
Uh...
AC_JHN_L3_510
And long, hard roads lead to the realest connections!
AC_JHN_L3_511
Oh...
AC_JHN_L3_512
Even Elphelt says so!
AC_JHN_L3_513
Hmm.
AC_JHN_L3_514
So don't worry, Johnny! I'm gonna be just fine!
AC_JHN_L3_515
Cause this is what grown-up love's all about!
AC_JHN_L3_516
...
AC_JHN_L3_517
Hoo boy.
vnag401demov_0_elp
Who goes there? And what did you just drop?
velp400demov_0_nag
Ooh, that's one way to start a love story!
AC_ELP_L1_101
Is this a marriage certificate--
AC_ELP_L1_102
Oh, Mister Samurai! How forward of you!
AC_ELP_L1_103
Hmm? You need this, don't you?
AC_ELP_L1_104
Oh, you're so very bold!
AC_ELP_L1_105
It belongs to you...
AC_ELP_L1_106
Are you proposing to me?!
AC_ELP_L1_107
What are you talking about?
AC_ELP_L1_108
(sigh) A love that starts at marriage... Two hearts that don't even know ^n;each other's favorite foods yet squabble their way ever closer!
AC_ELP_L1_109
Wait, are you... one of my fans?!
AC_ELP_L1_110
Your what?
AC_ELP_L1_111
I'm the shining frontwoman of the once-in-a-millennium band, ^n;Speothos Venaticus! Known for my all-too-relatable lyrics about love and marriage!
AC_ELP_L1_112
News to me.
AC_ELP_L1_113
Now, love me with all your soul!
AC_ELP_L1_114
Eeeeeek!
AC_ELP_L1_115
What?!
AC_ELP_L1_116
Where'd I put my wedding dress?!
AC_ELP_L1_117
Hey, wait!
AC_ELP_L1_118
See you later, dear!
AC_ELP_L1_119
Stop, you romantic rascal!
AC_ELP_L1_121
Someone's housekeys...
AC_ELP_L1_122
You're inviting me over?! Golly gee, this is happening so fast... ^n;"You already have the keys to my heart... and now to my home." ^n;What a proposal! Eeeeee!
AC_ELP_L1_123
Wait! I haven't said anything like--
AC_ELP_L1_124
You doth protest too much, methinks.
AC_ELP_L1_125
Huh?
AC_ELP_L1_126
I know a bright future awaits us both, dear! ^n;But I should really focus on my band right now!
AC_ELP_L1_127
No, I didn't--
AC_ELP_L1_128
Please wait for me until my dream comes true... oh, my future husband!
AC_ELP_L1_129
No, YOU wait!
AC_ELP_L1_201
So we meet again.
AC_ELP_L1_202
The plural of "coincidence" is "fate!" Help me, my destined darling!
AC_ELP_L1_211
Thank you! You were a huge help!
AC_ELP_L1_212
I was just passing by.
AC_ELP_L1_213
Be sure and pass by all the way to my next show!
AC_ELP_L1_214
Sorry. I don't have that kind of time.
AC_ELP_L1_215
Because you'd rather spend it all with me...?
AC_ELP_L1_216
Absolutely not!
AC_ELP_L1_217_1
(sigh) As I focus on my band practice, you focus on your training... ^n;We drift apart... But I cast a lonely look to the night sky, and it hits me! 
AC_ELP_L1_217_2
You must be under the same sky, gazing up at the same moon... 
AC_ELP_L1_217_3
That feeling motivates me to continue practicing, just as you continue your training! ^n;Love grows in the moonlight! Ahaaah! Beautiful, platonic love!
AC_ELP_L1_218
Tch. This is hopeless. I suppose it's all part of my training.
vfau401demow_0_elp
Be careful... running around... corners...
velp400demow_0_fau
Whoa! Don't jump out at me like that!
AC_ELP_L1_401
Hmm?
AC_ELP_L1_402
Mister Samurai!
AC_ELP_L1_403
Don't say a word. Just let us pass.
AC_ELP_L1_404
Are you... hurt?
AC_ELP_L1_405
My heart wavers between my future husband and this new encounter... ^n;My samurai, who knows my true heart before I speak and walks one step ahead of me... ^n;Or the dark, dashing doctor who expresses himself with his body, not words...
AC_ELP_L1_406
They both stand at the starting line, waiting for the other to make the first move! ^n;I'm caught between their deadly stares... ^n;Who?! Who will claim the hand of Elphelt Valentine?!
AC_ELP_L1_411
Stop! Please, don't fight over me anymore!
AC_ELP_L1_412
Wait, what the heck is this?!
AC_ELP_L1_413
An afro.
AC_ELP_L1_414
Two circles together... form a heart... heh heh heh.
AC_ELP_L1_415
One of you could've gotten a matching 'do...
AC_ELP_L1_416
That takes me back.
AC_ELP_L1_417
Huh?! You had an afro?! What a surprising thing to share!
AC_ELP_L1_418
Ooh, we should totally be afro twins!
AC_ELP_L1_419
Doctor Faust can officiate! It'll be a lovely wedding!
AC_ELP_L1_420
Great... responsibility...
AC_ELP_L1_421
Listen to me. I have not the slightest intention of marrying you.
AC_ELP_L1_422
It's too late to play hard to get now!
AC_ELP_L1_423
Wanna... match?
AC_ELP_L1_424
Did you hear me?!
AC_ELP_L1_425
Matchy-matchy...
AC_ELP_L1_426
Wait for me!
AC_ELP_L1_427
Wait...
AC_ELP_L1_428
No! Not one step closer!
AC_ELP_L1_429
Need... anesthetic...
AC_ELP_L1_430
You fools! Don't do this! Let me go! Noooooo!!
AC_ELP_L1_431
A chance meeting on the street kicks off a romance for the ages! Eeeeee!
AC_ELP_L1_441
Head... ache?
AC_ELP_L1_442
No, 'tis my heart that aches.
AC_ELP_L1_443
Once again I must choose, love or music? ^n;Am I adrift on the stormy sea of new encounters? ^n;Then let me rock and roll as the waves take me, ^n;and may I wash up on the shores of wedded bliss!
AC_ELP_L1_444
Oh, that could have been our reality... (sigh) But for now, I'm sorry.
AC_ELP_L1_445
I must seal my heart away 'til my goal is met. ^n;Please wait for me until then... if such is our destiny!
AC_ELP_L1_446
How long?
AC_ELP_L1_447
Well, we brought in ten fans this month, so at this rate...
AC_ELP_L1_448
We'll sell a million tickets for our world tour in... 8,334 years.
AC_ELP_L1_449
Ah ha ha ha ha...
AC_ELP_L1_450
No chance.
AC_ELP_L1_451
You said it.
AC_ELP_L1_452
Why haven't I realized all this time? I can't seal my heart away for that long!
AC_ELP_L1_453
That settles it! I must pursue love AND music!
AC_ELP_L1_454
Now then, Doctor Faust. Would you like to see where this encounter leads us? ^n;I see us in a small countryside home, surrounded by lots of nature... and lots of kids! ^n;Then lots of grandkids, great-grandkids, great-great-grandkids, ^n;and great-great-great-grandkids! Let's make generations of love and laughter!
AC_ELP_L1_455
Uh...
AC_ELP_L1_456
Oh! But before all the grandkids, we've got a wedding to plan--and a honeymoon! ^n;Want to hear what my ideal honeymoon looks like?
AC_ELP_L1_457
Scary...
AC_ELP_L1_458
On our nonstop flight to Paris, there's a sudden announcement! ^n;"Is there a doctor on the plane?!" ^n;My brave doctor rises to the occasion to discover the pilot has been shot in the heart!
AC_ELP_L1_459
Oogh...
AC_ELP_L1_460_1
With what breath he has left, the pilot begs, "play me a song." ^n;I must lift the crew's spirit through music! I have no choice but to sing! 
AC_ELP_L1_460_2
While I put on an impromptu concert, you perform emergency surgery. ^n;My voice does the soothing while your hands do the healing! 
AC_ELP_L1_460_3
It's a true power couple's first-ever duet!
AC_ELP_L1_461
Head... aching...
AC_ELP_L2_439
Don't jump out... Might collide...
AC_ELP_L2_440
We collide in the street... Will love come crashing in?!
AC_ELP_L2_401
Love...?
AC_ELP_L2_402
Yes! It's a high-impact meet cute!
AC_ELP_L2_403
Safety... first...
AC_ELP_L2_411
I'm sorry, but I'm already promised to another...
AC_ELP_L2_412
Wait, what the heck is this?!
AC_ELP_L2_413
An afro...
AC_ELP_L2_414
We've got matching afros?!
AC_ELP_L2_415
Good impact protection...
AC_ELP_L2_416
Ooh, right! Now we can bump into each other as hard as we like!
AC_ELP_L2_417
Scratch that! What's love without the thrill of a little risk?!
AC_ELP_L2_418
I'm... sorry...
AC_ELP_L2_419
Likewise...
AC_ELP_L2_420
I got too caught up in the love in front of me...
AC_ELP_L2_421
But I think my future husband will be upset if we have matching afros...
AC_ELP_L2_422
Have either of you seen a wannabe bride?
AC_ELP_L2_423
Mister Samurai!
AC_ELP_L2_424
Oh... It's you...
AC_ELP_L2_425
Were you worried about me?
AC_ELP_L2_426
No. I came to stop you.
AC_ELP_L2_427
You sure can be the jealous type!
AC_ELP_L2_428
Wrong! I have no intentions of marrying--
AC_ELP_L2_429
If you're that worried, you can put a ring on it right now! ^n;That's right... Let's elope, darling!
AC_ELP_L2_430
What...?
AC_ELP_L2_431
Oh... Congratulations...
AC_ELP_L2_432
I actually wrote a wedding march, just for a time like this!
AC_ELP_L2_433
That's... nice.
AC_ELP_L2_434
You can't possibly be serious, can you?
AC_ELP_L2_435
Say something.
AC_ELP_L2_436
I will now sing Speothos Venaticus' very own wedding march! 
AC_ELP_L2_437
I finally caught up with you...
AC_ELP_L2_438
The plural of "coincidence" is "fate!"
AC_ELP_L3_301
Listen to me!
AC_ELP_L3_302
Ready to work out a prenup?
AC_ELP_L3_303

AC_ELP_L3_303_1
For maximum marital bliss, we shall praise each other at least three times a day. ^n;Now, I do plan to continue my music career after marriage... 
AC_ELP_L3_303_2
I've only sold nine tickets so far, ^n;but as long as my music gets through to SOMEONE, I want to keep trying!
AC_ELP_L3_303_3
And I'm envisioning a world tour somewhere down the line. ^n;Would you be okay with that?
AC_ELP_L3_304
Why ask my permission?
AC_ELP_L3_311
Would you quit if I told you to?
AC_ELP_L3_312
No!
AC_ELP_L3_313
You mean... I don't have to give up on love OR music?
AC_ELP_L3_314
I see!
AC_ELP_L3_315
Seems the path has opened for you.
AC_ELP_L3_316
Yes! And it leads us right down the aisle!
AC_ELP_L3_317
Hmm?
AC_ELP_L3_318
We've got a honeymoon-slash-world tour to plan!
AC_ELP_L3_319
Not so fast! Wait!
AC_ELP_L3_320
Let's commit to a five-minute minimum on conversations, ^n;no matter how busy we get. And I won't quit my band even if we start a family, ^n;because I've got to give people hope with my music!
AC_ELP_L3_321
Continue as you will.
AC_ELP_L3_331
One must stay on their path, no matter who stands in the way.
AC_ELP_L3_332
However, this has nothing to do with me.
AC_ELP_L3_333
You're right!
AC_ELP_L3_334
My music motivates people... but my motivation is YOU!
AC_ELP_L3_335
I'll commit to both!
AC_ELP_L3_336
So you've found your path?
AC_ELP_L3_337
Yes! And it leads me down the aisle with my beloved husband!
AC_ELP_L3_338
Huh?!
AC_ELP_L3_339
The rest of my band will play us into the chapel, live!
AC_ELP_L3_340
I've got to get planning!
AC_ELP_L3_341
Wait! Stop! You misunderstand! WAIT!
vfau401demoy_0_elp
Dan... gerous...
velp400demoy_0_fau
A bump turns a street corner into love's own sumo ring!
AC_ELP_L3_401
I can feel new love come crashing in! But I'm already taken...
AC_ELP_L3_402
Wait a minute! Why am I so fluffy?!
AC_ELP_L3_403
Fluffy... hair...
AC_ELP_L3_404
This isn't right! I'm engaged! I can't be hair twins with you!
AC_ELP_L3_405
It... suits you...
AC_ELP_L3_406
Huh? You really think so?
AC_ELP_L3_407
Wedding... present...
AC_ELP_L3_408
Wow! Thank you so much!
AC_ELP_L3_409
For you... Oh.
AC_ELP_L3_410
Oh.
AC_ELP_L3_411
It withered...
AC_ELP_L3_412
My flower... wilted...
AC_ELP_L3_413
Th-That's not my fault!
AC_ELP_L3_501
There you are, flower...
AC_ELP_L3_502
Who, me? Oh, I'm back to normal!
AC_ELP_L3_503
Good for you...
AC_ELP_L3_504
All right! Wait for me...
AC_ELP_L3_505
My future husband--No, my future samurai!
AC_ELP_L3_506
You! Has a wannabe bride passed through here?
AC_ELP_L3_507
That way...
AC_ELP_L3_508
Getting a dress...
AC_ELP_L3_509
What? No! Whether it's white or pink makes no difference to me!
AC_ELP_L3_510
No, I don't mean not to wear one! Stop! Stop this at once!
AC_ELP_L3_511
Looks like fun... Heh heh heh...
velp400demoa_0
Phew! I almost lost my marriage certific--I mean my show flyer!
velp400demob_0

So it is.

Lovely sea, too... My favorite color.
AC_ABA_L1_104
So I see.
AC_ABA_L1_105
A blue so clear, you can peer into its depths...
AC_ABA_L1_106
Well expressed.
AC_ABA_L1_107
...I'm talking to Paracelsus, not you.
AC_ABA_L1_108
Pardon me. It didn't look like it.
AC_ABA_L1_109
How rude... Faking civility... Proudly ignorant...
AC_ABA_L1_110
Heh heh. Apologies. I'll take my leave.
AC_ABA_L1_111
Well, now... This is awkward...
AC_ABA_L1_121
We're busy! Go away!
AC_ABA_L1_122
Whatever may come, our love is eternal...
AC_ABA_L1_123
Isn't it, dear?
AC_ABA_L1_124
I hate to admit... it hardly seems worth asking for help at this point.
AC_ABA_L1_125
I've been meaning to ask...
AC_ABA_L1_126
What is your relationship, exactly?
AC_ABA_L1_127
...Nothing we need you to understand.
AC_ABA_L1_128
I see. Then I won't pry further.
AC_ABA_L1_201
Here to gawk, are you?
AC_ABA_L1_202
I'm only passing through.
AC_ABA_L1_211
Don't interrupt my time with Paracelsus...
AC_ABA_L1_212
Wouldn't dream of it. I'll be on my way.
velp401demow_0_aba
Ah, the two of you walk your own, endless wedding aisle! I'm sooo jealous!
vaba400demow_0_elp
We'll send you down the road to death...
AC_ABA_L1_401
Have you been well?
AC_ABA_L1_402
Not at all... It's one random attack after another.
AC_ABA_L1_403
How lovely! A journey for just the two of you! ^n;If only I had a wonderful partner like Paracelsus, too...
AC_ABA_L1_404
You wouldn't mind telling me the secret to your happy marriage, would you? ^n;For Elphelt Valentine's future reference!
AC_ABA_L1_405
Hmm... It's simple, right, dear?
AC_ABA_L1_406
Huh?
AC_ABA_L1_407
The secret is to eliminate any would-be homewrecker on sight!
AC_ABA_L1_411
... D-Do you understand?
AC_ABA_L1_412
L-Loud and clear!
AC_ABA_L1_413
You're saying it's all about teamwork! ^n;If there's anything you can't accomplish alone, the power of love can solve it!
AC_ABA_L1_414
Heh!
AC_ABA_L1_415
What are you talking about...?
AC_ABA_L1_416
It sounds like a valid conclusion... but it's actually a non sequitur.
AC_ABA_L1_417
Haah... I clearly need to reflect. ^n;To think I wasted all that time practicing cutting my wedding cake alone!
AC_ABA_L1_418
You're capable of reflection?
AC_ABA_L1_419
Reflecting on what, exactly?
AC_ABA_L1_420
Keh heh heh!
AC_ABA_L1_421
Sometimes a weapon, sometimes a lover... ^n;Love sure can come in strange shapes, ^n;but it's all a beautiful three-legged race you run together!
AC_ABA_L1_422
At least you're right about that. Right, dear?
AC_ABA_L1_423
Right... Wait, what?
AC_ABA_L1_424
...Ahahaha!
AC_ABA_L1_425
Whoa! I'm bubbling over with inspiration! ^n;Time for a surprise street show to debut my new song!
AC_ABA_L1_426
Eek! S-Suit yourself... Do as you please...
AC_ABA_L1_427
Scary! All of you are scary!
AC_ABA_L1_428
Keh heh... How lively.
AC_ABA_L1_431
Wahaaa! Love vitality!
AC_ABA_L1_432
Heh. I doubt you could comprehend the power of our love...
AC_ABA_L1_433
Right, dear?
AC_ABA_L1_434
Warped successes do tend to go to one's head.
AC_ABA_L1_435
How can you say such a thing...?
AC_ABA_L1_436
You must be breaking down... because you haven't found a worthy body yet.
AC_ABA_L1_437
I'm not breaking down! I'm as cool-headed as always.
AC_ABA_L1_438
I don't know where all your sludge comes from, either... ^n;As your loving wife, I need to work a little harder...
AC_ABA_L1_439
W-Will you stop? Listen to me for once. Just listen... please... Ah... Aaah...
velp401demox_0_aba
Aha! My Lovey-Dovey-Dar is pinging like crazy! ^n;Can I ask you a few questions?
vaba400demox_0_elp
Muh... Muh... Monster!!
AC_ABA_L2_401
My, my.
AC_ABA_L2_402
Please! I just want to talk!
AC_ABA_L2_403
A f-fiend... No, a vengeful spirit! Dear?!
AC_ABA_L2_404
Such undeniable fighting spirit... Such hidden power... ^n;There was a time when I would have leapt upon her without hesitation...
AC_ABA_L2_405
L-Leapt upon me? How bold...
AC_ABA_L2_406
Dear, how could you?! Aren't I enough for you?!
AC_ABA_L2_407
Did you listen? To the words I actually said?
AC_ABA_L2_408
This took a turn for the lively.
AC_ABA_L2_409
I won't let anyone take my Paracelsus!
AC_ABA_L2_411
I-I get it now!
AC_ABA_L2_412
I see the power of your love!
AC_ABA_L2_413
G-Good... Then you understand a bit.
AC_ABA_L2_414
This is what it means to be husband and wife. Right, dear?
AC_ABA_L2_415
Very informative! Hee hee... ^n;One day, I'll find my other half and we'll sparkle just like you two!
AC_ABA_L2_416
Spare no effort. You'll need it.
AC_ABA_L2_417
Yes, ma'am!
AC_ABA_L2_418
Um... Testament?
AC_ABA_L2_419
Yes?
AC_ABA_L2_420
Would you mind saving me from this hell I'm in?
AC_ABA_L2_421
Ah... Sorry, I'm only passing through.
AC_ABA_L2_422
Haah...
AC_ABA_L3_301
You're still here?
AC_ABA_L3_302
What's got you out of sorts?
AC_ABA_L3_303
...Your face. Your know-it-all face. It annoys me.
AC_ABA_L3_304
That seems extreme. Maybe the real issue lies within you.
AC_ABA_L3_305
Firm assumptions are double-edged blades. They tend to lead to ruin.
AC_ABA_L3_306
Shut up!
AC_ABA_L3_311
Haah... Haah... Why does it always end like this?
AC_ABA_L3_312
Why, you ask?
AC_ABA_L3_313
You may be rash, but you're not stupid. ^n;Surely you don't need a lecture from me to figure it out.
AC_ABA_L3_314
......
AC_ABA_L3_315
I'm anxious... and afraid that Paracelsus will leave me.
AC_ABA_L3_316
......
AC_ABA_L3_317
That feeling, or rather obsession, has an effect on him. ^n;At this rate, he won't be able to hold any shape before long.
AC_ABA_L3_318
...I knew it. It's my fault Paracelsus is... is...
AC_ABA_L3_319
If you care about him, that obsession needs to--
AC_ABA_L3_320
I'll stop.
AC_ABA_L3_321
What?
AC_ABA_L3_322
What?!
AC_ABA_L3_323
Look... It's not like I haven't thought about it before. ^n;Our relationship is... unhealthy.
AC_ABA_L3_324
I-I see. So your mind's made up?
AC_ABA_L3_325
This... This isn't love. I know that. ^n;The shackles of affection are still shackles, after all.
AC_ABA_L3_326
Dear... This is the end.
AC_ABA_L3_327
Hmm...
AC_ABA_L3_331
Self-righteous, aren't you?
AC_ABA_L3_332
Insolent, contemptible, boorish little scoundrel...
AC_ABA_L3_333
Foul-mouthed, too.
AC_ABA_L3_334
Irredeemable louse with a scant vocabulary...
AC_ABA_L3_335
Ah, the classic symptoms of a lack of confidence.
AC_ABA_L3_336
Rrrgh...
AC_ABA_L3_337
That's fine, as long as I have Paracelsus. He's all I need.
AC_ABA_L3_338
What does he think?
AC_ABA_L3_339
Paracelsus...?
AC_ABA_L3_340
Hmm.
AC_ABA_L3_341
At the very least, it's not my true will.
AC_ABA_L3_342
Wha...?
AC_ABA_L3_343
Hmm.
velp401demoy_0_aba
Yikes! My Lovey-Dovey-Dar says you're sinking!
vaba400demoy_0_elp
These bad bonds run deep...
AC_ABA_L3_401
Operation Romance Recon is a failure!
AC_ABA_L3_402
That's that. Though we were interrupted...
AC_ABA_L3_403
Dear... It's been so, so wonderful...
AC_ABA_L3_404
E-Even if it was only wonderful for me...
AC_ABA_L3_405
A.B.A. Being with you has been challenging, to say the least.
AC_ABA_L3_406
I'm suh-suh-sorry...
AC_ABA_L3_407
Just properly hear me out, please.
AC_ABA_L3_408
O-Okay...
AC_ABA_L3_409
Take care, dear... I mean... P-Paracelsus...
AC_ABA_L3_410
Sure, but... Why?
AC_ABA_L3_411
Huh? Because this is goodbye...
AC_ABA_L3_412
Goodbye?
AC_ABA_L3_413
I don't recall saying anything about wanting to part with you.
AC_ABA_L3_414
W-Wait... You mean...?
AC_ABA_L3_415
You mean what? What, what, whaaat?!
velp401demoz_0_aba
Paracelsus, please, open up your heart! ^n;Or else the suspense will keep me up at night!
vaba400demoz_0_elp
I'll put you to sleep right now...
AC_ABA_L3_501
Sorry! My passions really hit a crescendo there! ^n;But that's no excuse for interrupting a loving couple.
AC_ABA_L3_502
...Loving? Hmm.
AC_ABA_L3_503
I don't know about that. Loving... I understand the concept.
AC_ABA_L3_504
But... Just understanding something... ^n;Can one say that's the same as knowing it?
AC_ABA_L3_505
All this puzzling you're doing is a kind of love, too, A.B.A! ^n;And so is watching your back while you do it!
AC_ABA_L3_506
Right, Paracelsus?
AC_ABA_L3_507
Huh...Interesting
AC_ABA_L3_508
Ack! This time already?! I'm gonna be late to rehearsal again!
AC_ABA_L3_509
Now, then! I'll be waiting for my wedding invitation! Elphelt Valentine, out!
AC_ABA_L3_510
Hup!
AC_ABA_L3_511
Urk...
AC_ABA_L3_512
My head hurts...
AC_ABA_L3_513
How to put this... She's very energetic, isn't she? ^n;I may see some of the old me in her, too.
AC_ABA_L3_514
Really...? I doubt you were ever that reckless...
AC_ABA_L3_515
Well... My indiscriminate thirst for blood and strong opponents cost me my sanity. ^n;I manipulated you for a while, too, A.B.A.
AC_ABA_L3_516
Manipulated...? I wouldn't say that...
AC_ABA_L3_517
But I've always thought a relationship built on using each other is wrong. ^n;It's twisted.
AC_ABA_L3_518
...Right. You and I... might be twisted.
AC_ABA_L3_519
But still... I don't want to part ways with you.
AC_ABA_L3_520
No more confinement. No more manipulation. ^n;We'll meet each other halfway. What do you say to that?
AC_ABA_L3_521
...I don't think I can change my ways, Paracelsus. I don't.
AC_ABA_L3_522
My life as a homunculus is all I have. ^n;I don't know any other way to relate. I can't...
AC_ABA_L3_523
I don't know any other way, either. ^n;I mean, I'm an axe. But we can at least give it a try.
AC_ABA_L3_524
But... But...
AC_ABA_L3_525
Hnnh... Haah... Hooah!
AC_ABA_L3_527
Huh?!
AC_ABA_L3_528
Even if we don't know... No, BECAUSE we don't know... We can work it out together.
AC_ABA_L3_529
That's my answer, A.B.A. As your partner.
AC_ABA_L3_530
A blue so clear... you can peer into its depths...
AC_ABA_L3_531
A.B.A! Keep it together, A.B.A!
AC_ABA_L3_532
There's a lot that I don't know about the outside world.
AC_ABA_L3_533
But as long as I can walk along with you, that's enough for me.
vaba400demoa_0
Boorish, vulgar, ill-mannered animal...
vaba400demob_0

A brute in sheep's clothing... No reasoning with this one.
vaba400demoa_1
Brazen beast. All seduction, no substance.
vaba400demob_1
You think that will lead my Paracelsus astray...?
vaba400democ_1
Go away, go away, go away, go away...
vaba401demoa_0
I told you. You can't have him.
vaba401demob_0
Exterminate... No other conclusion...
vaba401democ_0
I'll make an example of you...
vaba401demoa_1
There's no cure for a twisted mind...
vaba401demob_1
You think you can tear our love apart?

Wicked, treacherous, worthless woman... Empty imitation...

Dull, delusional, senseless woman... Wallowing in dependence...

Together, forever... In perfect harmony... For all time... Uweh heh heh...
vaba402demob_0
With that obstacle gone... Let's talk, dear. We have all the time in the world.
vaba402democ_0
Well, dear? Kah ha ha! I'm the one for you, right?
vaba402demoa_1
You want what you can't have... Filthy homewrecker.
vaba402demob_1
That's all? You'd never make a good match for Paracelsus.
vaba402democ_1
Stay away from us. Or else... Next time... (You may leave in itty, bitty pieces...)
vaba402demoa_0_nag
Unflappable flagellant... You belong in a monastery or a museum.

vnag401demov_0_sly
I see you're still in good health.
vsly400demov_0_nag
Let your blade speak louder than your words.
AC_SLY_L1_101
Easy victory still seems so far away...
AC_SLY_L1_102
No need to feel dejected. I've got centuries more experience.
AC_SLY_L1_103
However... I still haven't proven a thing to you.
AC_SLY_L1_104
Then why not join me for a spot of leisure?
AC_SLY_L1_105
What sort of leisure...? No, I'll join you regardless.
AC_SLY_L1_111
To think you've gotten so strong. I'm impressed.
AC_SLY_L1_112
You honor me.
AC_SLY_L1_113
That spring in your step... You're seeking challengers again, aren't you?
AC_SLY_L1_114
Precisely. You've quite the memory.
AC_SLY_L1_115
For my own sake, I'd like to see more of how you are now. ^n;May I accompany you?
AC_SLY_L1_116
Of course. Provided that you can keep up with me.
AC_SLY_L1_201
Pardon my intrusion.
AC_SLY_L1_202
You youngsters and your vigor...
AC_SLY_L1_211
No surprise that felt familiar. ^n;It goes to show you're my progenitor indeed.
AC_SLY_L1_212
Even though you left me after a few mere decades?
AC_SLY_L1_213
...I was young then. Or perhaps greener, at least... Hmm.
AC_SLY_L1_214
And it's made you into who you are now. Not so bad, is it?
vzat401demow_0_sly
I'm sorry to interrupt your stroll.
vsly400demow_0_zat
Nonsense. You came at the perfect time.
AC_SLY_L1_401
Let me prove myself a better student of Dandyism ^n;than that onigiri-scarfing samurai.
AC_SLY_L1_402
I see. Lend me a hand for a bit, Nagoriyuki.
AC_SLY_L1_403
If Zato manages to defeat the both of us, ^n;I'll acknowledge him as the Number One Dandy.
AC_SLY_L1_404
Understood... Wait. Isn't this a battle I should fight myself?
AC_SLY_L1_411
That's enough. What do you think, Sir Slayer?
AC_SLY_L1_412
Impressive. ^n;Yours is a smooth and tasteful interpretation of Dandyism indeed.
AC_SLY_L1_413
So I've met your standard, then? I'm honored.
AC_SLY_L1_414
Still... It may be past time for asking, but who exactly is this samurai?
AC_SLY_L1_415
Looking back a few centuries.... ^n;Well, you could say he's a former pupil who ran off before a hundred years were up.
AC_SLY_L1_416
I was still green. All the same, I'm grateful for what you made of me.
AC_SLY_L1_417
You could thank yourself for leaving, too. ^n;It's fascinating how well you've turned out.
AC_SLY_L1_418
I see.
AC_SLY_L1_419
As they say, if you love a child, send them out into the world... ^n;Perhaps I'll do some drifting myself.
AC_SLY_L1_420
You could ask Millia about travel expenses.
AC_SLY_L1_421
No, that's not quite... Hmmn.
AC_SLY_L1_431
Hmm. Did you have Venom's croissants for lunch, perhaps?
AC_SLY_L1_432
What? How did you know?
AC_SLY_L1_433
When one has observed you humans for as long as I have, ^n;one learns that quite a lot can be read in your fists.
AC_SLY_L1_434
Indeed. ^n;It's as though I could hear the croissants themselves answering me.
AC_SLY_L1_435
Venom baked us, they say.
AC_SLY_L1_436
Hrm.
AC_SLY_L1_437
More applied Dandyism, I take it.
AC_SLY_L1_438
Very little gets by me, I assure you.
AC_SLY_L1_439
Could I ever master such a skill?
AC_SLY_L1_440
Of course. It shall be mine.
AC_SLY_L1_441
I must order bread to train with at once. Bagels, baguettes, brioche...
AC_SLY_L1_442
The will to improve is a beautiful thing. Do your best.
vzat401demox_0_sly
Have you forgotten? I'm your disciple as well.
vsly400demox_0_zat
You certainly don't want for vigor.
AC_SLY_L2_401
I am the true inheritor of Dandyism.
AC_SLY_L2_402
Fool! I am your senior!
AC_SLY_L2_403
Ha ha! Enough chirping. I remain the original Dandy!
AC_SLY_L2_404
Then I shall defeat you both at once, ^n;and prove that none understand Sir Slayer's teachings like I do... ^n;In this world or the next.
AC_SLY_L2_405
Ridiculous. You stand no chance against the both of us.
AC_SLY_L2_406
Keh heh heh...
AC_SLY_L2_411
Zato, Nagoriyuki--I see you've both polished yourselves to distinction. ^n;That was truly enjoyable.
AC_SLY_L2_412
You're as overwhelming as always.
AC_SLY_L2_413
Was there even any point in my being here?
AC_SLY_L2_414
Of course, you knew I'd steal the stage, my young friends.
AC_SLY_L2_415
You truly haven't dulled a bit.
AC_SLY_L2_416
The years only make me stronger.
AC_SLY_L2_417
It can't be that simple. ^n;More years must also mean more suffering and hardship.
AC_SLY_L2_418
......
AC_SLY_L2_419
I know what you must think, but eternity really isn't all bad.
AC_SLY_L2_420
Why, I got to see a troubled old friend find his own splendid path.
AC_SLY_L2_421
Only because I found a guidepost amid the flow of time.
AC_SLY_L2_422
But most can't bear the passage of so much time. In which case...
AC_SLY_L2_423
Dying for a while may be an option. ^n;A reset on all worries. It really clears the head.
AC_SLY_L2_424
Oh... That may be...
AC_SLY_L2_425
However... Some things remain stained on the body.
AC_SLY_L2_426
For one, ^n;the iron will to keep one's life or death out of the bounds of consideration.
AC_SLY_L2_427
For two, ^n;the art of molding that iron will into shape, and the pride that it brings.
AC_SLY_L2_428
For three, ^n;what truly decides a battle. Not will, pride, victory, life, or death, ^n;but that which delivers those in peril and preserves those in privilege. ^n;That is to say...
AC_SLY_L2_429
Dandyism.
AC_SLY_L2_430
Heh... Very good.
AC_SLY_L2_431
(I may have feared my seeds wouldn't take root... ^n;but it seems they've grown to bloom on their own.)
AC_SLY_L3_301
Please witness how far I've come.
AC_SLY_L3_302
Do try to satisfy me this time.
AC_SLY_L3_311
I knew it. I cannot surpass you.
AC_SLY_L3_312
Oh? You did well enough.
AC_SLY_L3_313
I know I've kept my distance, but a true student surpasses their teacher. ^n;I cannot repay my debt like this.
AC_SLY_L3_314
I wish to settle my past shame.
AC_SLY_L3_315
I didn't bite you so you could apologize.
AC_SLY_L3_316
I saw a man on the verge of death, and I bit him to keep his lamp alight.
AC_SLY_L3_317
But what happens to a man's heart when he suddenly finds himself a vampire? ^n;I had no idea.
AC_SLY_L3_318
How young I was... I can't say I was very responsible.
AC_SLY_L3_319
And you are today?
AC_SLY_L3_320
Now, who's to say?
AC_SLY_L3_321
......
AC_SLY_L3_322
I've seen the unification and collapse of all under the heavens.
AC_SLY_L3_323
If I had died back then, I wouldn't have known any of that. ^n;This long life of mine hasn't been such a bad thing.
AC_SLY_L3_324
...Though I'd rather you-know-who never catch me again.
AC_SLY_L3_325
All that remains now is to find my own path forward.
AC_SLY_L3_326
I see...
AC_SLY_L3_327
You needn't doubt any longer. I pray you have a wonderful journey.
AC_SLY_L3_331
Ah, impressive. Quite satisfying.
AC_SLY_L3_332
Alas, I still cannot reach you. Unfortunately.
AC_SLY_L3_333
I'd say it was worthwhile.
AC_SLY_L3_334
You seek the strong. I wish to answer.
AC_SLY_L3_335
Do lighten up a bit.
AC_SLY_L3_336
Tell you what. You should join me in writing haiku from time to time. ^n;We'll wash our verse down with a trip to my wine cellar.
AC_SLY_L3_337
I have some old vintages with your name on them. ^n;Unless you'd prefer tomato juice.
AC_SLY_L3_338
Considering the indescribable look on your face the first time you tasted wine...
AC_SLY_L3_339
...How many centuries ago was that?
AC_SLY_L3_340
You were my first student, after all. ^n;I should remember. As I recall, it was 683 years and...
AC_SLY_L3_341
Please, forget it! Time really hasn't dulled you...
AC_SLY_L3_342
(To think someone still remembers the past, even hundreds of years later... ^n;I truly am blessed.)
vzat401demoy_0_sly
Face me!
vsly400demoy_0_zat
Oh! Challengers are always quite welcome.
AC_SLY_L3_401
I saw you, Sir Slayer. With that dandy vampire samurai.
AC_SLY_L3_402
I heard you, too. You two were enjoying yourselves.
AC_SLY_L3_403
But I'M the one who held tight to Dandyism through death and rebirth...
AC_SLY_L3_404
Ngh... Sir Slayer...
AC_SLY_L3_405
Keh heh... What is it?
AC_SLY_L3_406
I inherited your ideals. I passed them down to the Guild. And so...
AC_SLY_L3_407
My Dandyism surpasses his... and I shall prove it.
AC_SLY_L3_408
That's the spirit. Prove away! Show me your Dandyism!
vzat401demoz_0_sly
Now, then. I request a follow-up test.
vsly400demoz_0_zat
Not discouraged yet? Very well.
AC_SLY_L3_501
The day has come when I can show you my full power. How moving.
AC_SLY_L3_502
You pass!
AC_SLY_L3_503
All of history is but the blink of an eye in the face of your overwhelming Dandyism...
AC_SLY_L3_504
Here I thought your new environment would shape you... ^n;but you haven't changed. And yet you have.
AC_SLY_L3_505
Yes. As you say.
AC_SLY_L3_506
There's only one who can fulfill you.
AC_SLY_L3_507
Yes. And that which delivers those in peril and preserves those in privilege.
AC_SLY_L3_508
It's caused a stirring within me...
AC_SLY_L3_509
And, it seems, become a power of your own.
AC_SLY_L3_510
...Ah, indeed, I never grow bored of you.
AC_SLY_L3_511
In all of your ephemeral, yet beautiful, radiance... You truly, truly captivate me.
vsly400demoa_0
My lovely wife is waiting. Let's make this quick.
vsly400demob_0
Such charming spirit, if you can keep it up.
vsly400democ_0
No need to worry. I've gotten good at holding back.
vsly400demoa_1
My, my. Care for a dance?
vsly400demoa_2
Glad to see you're energetic. Just like a youngster should be.
vsly401demoa_0
Now, then. Entertain me, won't you?
vsly401demob_0
Perfect for a bit of sport.
vsly401democ_0
I shall teach you what battle is.
vsly401demoa_1
Do you require an escort?
vsly401demob_2
Try to calm down. Stress is bad for the blood.
vsol401demoa_0_sly
Hurry up and retire already.
vsly400demoa_0_sol
But I'm not bored with you yet.
vsly401demoa_0_sol
Is this for play, or for keeps?
vsol400demoa_0_sly
I can go all out with you.
vmll401demoa_0_sly
When does a vampire retire?
vsly400demoa_0_mll
Good question. Do you plan to hire me?
vsly401demoa_0_mll
Splendid. You've grown from seed to trunk.
vmll400demoa_0_sly
What about you? A withered tree?
vzat401demoa_0_sly
Show me what you can do.
vsly400demoa_0_zat
Nonsense. I'm here to learn from you.
vsly401demoa_0_zat
How would you grade my vintage?
vzat400demoa_0_sly
You're at your ten-year best. Whatever that means.
vnag401demoa_0_sly
Have a taste of my blade.
vsly400demoa_0_nag
I shall partake.
vsly401demoa_0_nag
Samurai, eh? You found a fine path.
vnag400demoa_0_sly
I fight to surpass you, and myself alike.
vsly401demoa_0_sly
Surei-ya's contemplation on a comfortable retirement.
vsly400demoa_0_sly
Away from the world, along his secluded path, strides the pioneer.
vsly401demob_0_sly
Surei-ya's contemplation on a fierce warrior.
vsly400demob_0_sly
The broadest of grins... fangs hidden behind the lips... Asura, perhaps.
vsly401democ_0_sly
Surei-ya's contemplation on a gentleman.
vsly400democ_0_sly
Happily wedded... On the battlefield called 'home,' his wife always wins.

He's immortal, but that just makes him sexier.

Welcome to the world of Guilty Gear -Strive-!^n;Would you like to play through the Tutorial to learn the basics of this game?
Title_Text_TutorialFinish
TUTORIAL COMPLETE
TutorialFinish_Message_01
Congratulations!^n;That concludes the tutorial.
TutorialFinish_Message_02
Although some of the moves you've learned here cannot be done with certain characters, those characters can perform other powerful moves that are unique to them.^n;^n;There are many unique characters in this game, and that's one of the charms of Guilty Gear!
TutorialFinish_Message_03
To learn more about the functionality and technique of the other characters, we recommend you to play through the Mission Mode.
TutorialFinish_Message_04
Proceed to Mission Mode?
vkyk401demou
Heading out on the road again, Sol?
vsol400demou
Yeah, bounty hunter, remember?
TU_TA1_01
You did save the world, you know.
TU_TA1_02
What's your point?
TU_TA1_03
It was all over the papers.
TU_TA1_04
The people see you as a hero now.
TU_TA1_05
Ah, hell. Don't tell me you wanna teach me to act like one.
TU_TA1_06
Well, yes. By order of the new Conclave.
TU_TA1_07
It's just a formality. Won't take long.
TU_TA1_08
Still a pain in the ass...
TU_TA2_01
We almost done with this bullshit?
TU_TA2_02
We're done. Like I said, it was just a formality.
TU_TA2_03
Why didn't you just tell 'em you trained me, save us the trouble?
TU_TA2_04
They wanted video. How conviently obnoxious things are nowadays.
TU_TA2_05
I see. Then let's give 'em one final recording that'll really knock 'em on their asses.
TU_TA2_06
Now there's an idea.
TU_TA2_07
This time, I'll hold nothing back!
TU_TA3_01
That should do it.
TU_TA3_02
Remember, you can brush up on what^n;you learned today at the DOJO.
TU_TA3_03
There are other practical techniques to be learned there, too.
TU_TA3_04
You tryin' to tell me I need to hit the DOJO?
TU_TA3_05
Like I said, this is a formality.
TU_TA3_06
You can do whatever you want.
TU_TA3_07
And here I was, ready to go all out.
TU_TA3_08
Save that energy for your battle with the Gear Maker.
TU_TA3_09
Hmph...
TU_TA3_10
Do keep in touch while you're out on the road.
TU_BT1_01
We just need a record of me teaching you.^n;Now, come at me.^n;This will be over once you reduce my health to 0.
TU_BT1_02
What's the matter?^n;Try approaching me.
TU_BT1_03
Good. I'm going to start evading now.^n;Try to land some attacks on me.
TU_BT1_04
Mind your footwork.^n;Try to keep up with me.
TU_BT1_05
All right. I'll start attacking now.^n;Try to stay on the offensive.
TU_BT1_06
You may be immortal, sure,^n;but do remember to guard.
TU_BT1_07
You've forced me to use my Burst.^n;You can use your own to escape while you're being attacked.
TU_BT1_08
Don't forget to use your Burst.^n;It can help you escape when you're in a tight spot.
TU_BT1_09
Why don't we make this a regular duel now?^n;I don't intend to go easy on you.
TU_BT1_10
I'll be giving this my all. So should you.
TU_BT2_01
An air dash?^n;Not bad.
TU_BT2_02
What a jump!^n;That's one way to get the high ground.
TU_BT2_03
A special attack already?^n;Are you the one testing me?
TU_BT2_04
An Overdrive? You did hear me when I said^n;this was just a formality, right?
TU_BT2_05
You used a Roman Cancel?^n;So much for this being a training match.
TU_BT2_06
Do my eyes deceive me?^n;You look like you're enjoying yourself.
TU_BT2_07
Good.
TU_BT2_08
Ah, lovely. Thanks for being so cooperative.
TU_BT2_09
Excellent footwork.^n;Don't need to teach you that, I see.
TU_BT2_10
Using a Roman Cancel to counterattack?^n;Someone's in a hurry to get this over with.
TU_BT2_11
A Burst?^n;Wow, you really are taking this seriously.
TU_BT2_12
I told you, didn't I?^n;I'm giving this my all.
TU_BT2_13
You got me. Clearly I need to focus up.

LobbyTutorial_Text_005
Tres bien.^n;It seems you have a refined taste in fashion.^n;However, if you're unsatisfied with your outfit, ^n;you can change it anytime.

LobbyTutorial_Text_016
 ^n;Oh, seems like we have a challenger.
LobbyTutorial_Text_017

LobbyTutorial_Text_018
Those seeking battle wield their weapon^n;at the Duel Station.
LobbyTutorial_Text_019
You could ignore him, but since you are here,^n;why not challenge him to a battle?
LobbyTutorial_Text_020
 ^n;First, let's select the character that you'll use.

LobbyTutorial_Text_026
I see, you're testing his patience.^n;Remember, you can challenge someone to a match by^n;approaching and examining them when they have their weapon up.
LobbyTutorial_Text_027
I've heard that a famous swordsman^n;used to throw his opponent off^n;by making them agitated.
LobbyTutorial_Text_028
I'm running out of things to say.^n;Please begin the battle.
LobbyTutorial_Text_029
Let me know when you're ready to fight...

StoryMainChapterDesc01
――Year 2187. Sol Badguy has defeated the new threat, the "Universal Will." During his brief respite, he receives the news that "Asuka R. Kreutz," also known as "That Man," has surrendered to the United States of America.^n;To determine his true intentions, Sol sets off on a journey once again.
StoryMainChapterDesc02
During her raid on the Illyria Castle basement, I-No extracted "something" from the Universal Will. It took the form of a human, calling himself Chaos.^n;^n;Although the news about this assault was spread quickly, U.S. President Vernon decides to proceed with the G4 Summit as scheduled.^n;What is Asuka's objective in attending the G4 Summit?
StoryMainChapterDesc03
Appointed as a Knight to protect the President at the G4 Summit, Sol complies to the summons when he learns that Asuka will be present at the Summit as well.^n;^n;At the same time, Chaos destroys a large building in a town in Illyria. From beneath the destroyed building emerged Nagoriyuki, a well-built samurai with extraordinary power.
StoryMainChapterDesc04
Sensing some irregularity in I-No's action, Sol suspects the possibility of an accomplice who is acting separately. He eventually faces off with the mysterious being Chaos but fails to apprehend him due to the interjection of Nagoriyuki.^n;^n;As signs of unrest spread across the world before the G4 Summit, Sol's companion, Jack-O', ponders about her own existence.
StoryMainChapterDesc05
The G4 Summit finally commences.^n;^n;With the topic, a new peace in a new generation as the Summit's agenda, Asuka, who had been vilified as the "Demon King," reveals the entire truth.^n;^n;Not missing this opportunity, Chaos sets his plan in motion.
StoryMainChapterDesc06
Having taken control of the security system, Chaos begins to reign tyranny within the White House and hold the leaders as hostages, demanding the "Tome of Origin."^n;The Tome is currently in possession of Asuka, and only President Vernon can access the room Asuka is presently held in.^n;^n;To protect President Vernon, Sol is forced to flee from the pursuers.
StoryMainChapterDesc07
The sight of the White House, armed with an arsenal of weapons to deter any invaders, making a sudden ascent to the sky leaves all witnesses flabbergasted.^n;^n;Asuka shares with the rest Chaos's true identity as "The Original," the strongest mage ever known, who spread the use of Magic to humankind.^n;With everything in Chaos's grasp, all hope seems lost, but――
StoryMainChapterDesc08
While the world watches on as the situation unfolds, the hostages have been released thanks to Allied King Daryl's scheme.^n;^n;While Asuka and Chaos vie for control of the White House, Sol faces off Nagoriyuki once again.^n;At the height of this deadly feud, what awaited them is――
StoryMainChapterDesc09
At the hands of Asuka, the hero Sol is dead, and the human Frederick Balsara has been revived.^n;However, Chaos, who was thought once defeated, reaches out once again.^n;^n;The final battle begins as all the gears are set in motion once again.
